      What is Chemical Reaction? 
    </h1>
    <p class="topic-cover-text">
      A chemical reaction is a process in which substances, known as reactants, undergo a transformation to form new substances, called products. During this process, chemical bonds between atoms in the reactants are broken and reformed, resulting in the creation of different molecules with new properties. Chemical reactions are governed by the laws of conservation of mass and energy, meaning that the total mass and energy before and after the reaction remain constant. These reactions can be exothermic (releasing energy) or endothermic (absorbing energy), and they occur in various forms such as synthesis, decomposition, combustion, and oxidation-reduction (redox) reactions. <br> <br>

      One common example of a chemical reaction in daily life is the process of baking bread. When you mix ingredients like flour, water, yeast, and sugar and then bake the dough in an oven, a series of chemical reactions occur. The yeast ferments the sugar, producing carbon dioxide gas, which causes the dough to rise. Meanwhile, the heat from the oven causes the proteins and starches in the dough to undergo chemical changes, resulting in the formation of a crust and the soft, airy texture of the bread. The delicious aroma of freshly baked bread is also due to chemical reactions that produce various flavorful compounds. This everyday example illustrates how chemical reactions are integral to cooking and baking, transforming raw ingredients into finished products with different textures, flavors, and appearances.

      The Discovery of the Law of Conservation of Mass by Antoine Lavoisier (1789) 
  </h2>
  <p class="topic-cover-text">
      Antoine Lavoisier, often called the "Father of Modern Chemistry," made one of the most fundamental contributions to the study of chemical reactions with his discovery of the Law of Conservation of Mass. In 1789, Lavoisier demonstrated that during a chemical reaction, the total mass of the reactants equals the total mass of the products. This principle established that mass is neither created nor destroyed in a chemical reaction. Lavoisier's work laid the foundation for modern chemistry, allowing scientists to predict the outcomes of chemical reactions with greater accuracy and leading to the development of stoichiometry, which is essential for balancing chemical equations and understanding reaction mechanisms. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_of_mass" class="info-link">More about Law of Conservation of Mass</a>

      John Dalton's atomic theory, published in 1808, revolutionized the understanding of chemical reactions by introducing the concept that matter is composed of indivisible atoms. Dalton proposed that atoms of different elements combine in fixed ratios to form compounds and that chemical reactions involve the rearrangement of these atoms. This theory provided a scientific explanation for the observations made by Lavoisier and others, offering a molecular-level understanding of chemical reactions. Dalton's atomic theory is a cornerstone of modern chemistry and has been crucial in advancing the study of chemical reactions, including the development of the periodic table and molecular chemistry. <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/science/chemistry/atomic-structure-and-properties/history-of-atomic-structure/a/daltons-atomic-theory-version-2" class="info-link">More about Atomic Theory by John Dalton</a>

  <p class="topic-cover-text">
      Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff, a Dutch physical chemist, made significant contributions to understanding chemical reaction mechanisms in the late 19th century. In 1884, he introduced the concept of reaction rates and proposed that reaction rates depend on the concentration of reactants, temperature, and the presence of catalysts. Van 't Hoff's work on chemical kinetics, particularly his development of the Arrhenius equation, provided a quantitative framework for studying how reactions occur over time. This research is essential for designing chemical processes and understanding how different factors influence the speed and outcome of reactions, playing a critical role in industrial chemistry, pharmacology, and materials science.

      Facts about Chemical Reactions
    </h1>
    <p class="topic-cover-text">
      While many people are familiar with chemical reactions as processes that transform reactants into products, it's less commonly known that many chemical reactions are reversible. In a reversible reaction, the products can react with each other to regenerate the original reactants. This concept is critical in understanding chemical equilibrium, where the forward and reverse reactions occur at the same rate, resulting in a stable mixture of reactants and products. Reversible reactions are essential in biological systems, such as in cellular respiration and photosynthesis, where equilibrium is crucial for maintaining life processes.
 <br> <br>

      Enzymes, which are biological molecules (typically proteins), act as catalysts to speed up chemical reactions in living organisms. What is less known is how highly specific these enzymes are, often catalyzing only one type of reaction or reacting with only one type of substrate. This specificity allows for the precise regulation of biochemical pathways in the body, ensuring that the right reactions happen at the right time and place. Enzymes are involved in digestion, DNA replication, energy production, and many other critical processes, making them indispensable for life.   <br> <br>

      Some chemical reactions can proceed without the need for external energy input, relying instead on the energy stored in the chemical bonds of the reactants. These reactions are known as exergonic reactions, where the energy released exceeds the energy required to initiate the reaction. A familiar example is the combustion of fuel, such as in a car engine or a fireplace, where the chemical bonds in the fuel break and form new bonds in the products, releasing energy in the form of heat and light. This concept is crucial in fields like energy production and storage, where harnessing naturally exergonic reactions is key. <br> <br>

      A less commonly known type of chemical reaction is the photochemical reaction, which is driven by the absorption of light energy. These reactions are essential in processes like photosynthesis, where plants convert sunlight into chemical energy stored in glucose. Another example is the formation of vitamin D in human skin, which occurs when UV light from the sun triggers a chemical reaction in a cholesterol derivative. Photochemical reactions also play a role in the degradation of plastics and other materials exposed to sunlight, highlighting their importance in both natural and industrial contexts.
      <br> <br>

      While itâ€™s common knowledge that some chemical reactions release heat (exothermic), it's less well-known that some reactions absorb heat from their surroundings (endothermic). Endothermic reactions require an input of energy to proceed, which can make them appear less intuitive than exothermic reactions. A daily life example of an endothermic reaction is the process of photosynthesis in plants, where energy from sunlight is absorbed to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen. Understanding both types of reactions is crucial for fields like chemistry and engineering, where controlling temperature is often key to achieving desired outcomes in processes and manufacturing.
