      <!-- Exoplanets -->
      <h2 class="astro-header">
        Exoplanets
      </h2>
      <p class="astro-topic-text">
        Exoplanets are planets that orbit stars outside our solar system. Studying exoplanets involves detecting and characterizing these distant worlds to understand their properties, potential habitability, and their role in the broader context of planetary systems.

    <h1 class="astro-header">
      Facts about Astronomy
    </h1>
    <p class="astro-topic-text">
      Despite the vast number of stars, planets, and galaxies, the majority of the universe is empty space. In fact, the distances between celestial objects are so enormous that if you could shrink down to the size of an atom, the nearest star to Earth would still be over 4 light-years away, and much of the space in between would be devoid of matter. This expansive emptiness is a fundamental characteristic of the universe, affecting everything from the movement of galaxies to the propagation of light.<br> <br>

      While most people know about massive stars, the largest known star in terms of volume is UY Scuti, a red supergiant star. Located about 9,500 light-years away, UY Scuti has a radius around 1,700 times that of the Sun. This enormous size makes it a fascinating subject for studying the limits of stellar expansion and the life cycles of the most massive stars.<br> <br>

      The Sun's magnetic field undergoes a complete reversal approximately every 11 years as part of the solar cycle. During this period, the Sun's magnetic poles switch places, which affects solar activity, including sunspots, solar flares, and coronal mass ejections. This magnetic reversal plays a crucial role in space weather and can impact satellite communications and power grids on Earth.<br> <br>

      Neutron stars are among the densest objects in the universe. After a supernova explosion, the core left behind can compress the mass of up to 1.5 times that of the Sun into a sphere with a radius of about 10 to 15 kilometers (6 to 9 miles). This means a single teaspoon of neutron star material would weigh about 10 million tons on Earth. The extreme density of neutron stars provides valuable insights into the state of matter under intense gravitational and pressure conditions. <br> <br>

      Galaxies are not static; they can collide and merge with one another. The Milky Way, for example, is on a collision course with the Andromeda Galaxy, which will occur in about 4.5 billion years. Such cosmic events are significant for understanding the large-scale structure and evolution of the universe. When galaxies merge, they can trigger new star formation and redistribute interstellar material, leading to the creation of new galactic structures.
