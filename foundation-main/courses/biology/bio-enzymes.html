      What is Enzyme?
    </h1>
    <p class="topic-cover-text">
      An enzyme is a type of protein that acts as a biological catalyst, speeding up chemical reactions in living organisms without being consumed in the process. Enzymes work by lowering the activation energy needed for a reaction to occur, making it easier and faster for the reaction to proceed. They are highly specific, meaning each enzyme only catalyzes a particular type of reaction or works with specific substrates. For example, the enzyme lactase is responsible for breaking down lactose, the sugar found in milk, into simpler sugars that can be easily absorbed by the body.<br> <br>


      A common example of enzymes in daily life is the action of digestive enzymes in our stomach. When we eat food, enzymes like amylase, protease, and lipase help break down carbohydrates, proteins, and fats, respectively. Amylase, found in saliva, starts breaking down starches into sugars as soon as we begin chewing. This process continues in the stomach and small intestine with the help of other digestive enzymes, allowing our bodies to absorb the nutrients from food. Without these enzymes, the food we eat would not be properly digested, and we would not be able to extract the essential nutrients needed for our health and energy.

    <!-- Binding to the Substrate -->
    <h2 class="topic-header">
      Binding to the Substrate
    </h2>
    <p class="topic-cover-text">
      Enzymes function by binding to specific molecules known as substrates. These are the reactants in a biochemical reaction that the enzyme will help transform. The enzyme has a special region called the active site where the substrate binds. The active site is like a lock that fits a particular key, which in this case is the substrate. This specificity is due to the unique shape and chemical environment of the active site.
    </p>

    <!-- Formation of the Enzyme-Substrate Complex -->
    <h2 class="topic-header">
      Formation of the Enzyme-Substrate Complex
    </h2>
    <p class="topic-cover-text">
      Once the substrate binds to the active site, it forms an enzyme-substrate complex. This complex is a temporary structure where the enzyme and substrate are held together. The enzyme's active site may undergo a slight change in shape to better fit the substrate, a process known as induced fit. This precise alignment helps lower the activation energy required for the reaction to occur, making it easier for the chemical bonds in the substrate to break and new bonds to form.
    </p>

    <!-- Catalysis and Conversion -->
    <h2 class="topic-header">
      Catalysis and Conversion
    </h2>
    <p class="topic-cover-text">
      Within the enzyme-substrate complex, the enzyme facilitates the chemical reaction. It may do this by stressing certain bonds in the substrate, bringing reactants closer together, or providing a conducive environment for the reaction. For example, the enzyme may provide an acidic or basic environment that helps break chemical bonds. As a result, the substrate is converted into new products.
    </p>

    <!-- Release of Products -->
    <h2 class="topic-header">
      Release of Products
    </h2>
    <p class="topic-cover-text">
      After the reaction, the newly formed products have a different shape and chemical properties compared to the substrate. This change causes them to no longer fit well in the active site. Consequently, the products are released from the enzyme, freeing the active site for another round of reaction. The enzyme itself remains unchanged and can continue to catalyze additional reactions.
    </p>

    <!-- Reusability -->
    <h2 class="topic-header">
      Reusability
    </h2>
    <p class="topic-cover-text">
      One of the key features of enzymes is their ability to be reused. Since enzymes are not consumed or permanently altered by the reactions they catalyze, they can repeatedly catalyze many reactions. This efficiency makes enzymes highly effective in regulating and accelerating biochemical processes within cells.

    Discovery of Enzymes (Late 19th Century)
  </h2>
  <p class="topic-cover-text">
    The study of enzymes began in the late 19th century with the discovery of their existence and function. One of the earliest and most influential discoveries came from the work of French chemist Louis Pasteur. In the 1860s, Pasteur demonstrated that certain substances could speed up fermentation, a process in which sugars are converted into alcohol and carbon dioxide. He coined the term "ferments" to describe these substances. This discovery laid the foundation for the understanding of enzymes as biological catalysts that accelerate chemical reactions in living organisms.

  <p class="topic-cover-text">
    In 1894, Emil Fischer proposed the lock-and-key model of enzyme action. Fischer suggested that the enzyme's active site is a specific shape that fits precisely with the substrate, much like a key fits into a lock. This model was groundbreaking because it explained why enzymes are so specific in their action. The model helped to understand how enzymes bind to their substrates and catalyze reactions, providing a framework for further studies on enzyme specificity and function.

    In 1958, Daniel Koshland introduced the induced fit model, which refined Fischer’s lock-and-key model. Koshland proposed that the enzyme's active site is flexible and can change shape to better accommodate the substrate. This change in shape helps to stabilize the transition state of the reaction, making it easier for the enzyme to catalyze the reaction. The induced fit model improved our understanding of how enzymes work and allowed scientists to investigate how enzyme activity can be regulated and altered.

    The Discovery of Enzyme Kinetics (1903-1920s)

  <p class="topic-cover-text">
    In the early 20th century, Leonor Michaelis and Maud Menten developed the Michaelis-Menten equation, which describes the rate of enzyme-catalyzed reactions. Their research provided a quantitative framework for understanding how enzyme activity depends on substrate concentration. The Michaelis-Menten equation allows scientists to determine important parameters such as the maximum reaction rate (V_max) and the substrate concentration at which the reaction rate is half of V_max (K_m). This work was crucial for studying enzyme efficiency and how various factors affect enzyme activity.

  <div class="topic-cover enzyme-facts">
    <h1 class="topic-header">
      Facts about Enzyme
    </h1>
    <p class="topic-cover-text">
      Enzymes are highly sensitive to temperature. Each enzyme has an optimal temperature range within which it functions most efficiently. For example, human enzymes typically work best at around 37°C (98.6°F), which is the normal body temperature. If the temperature deviates significantly from this optimal range, enzyme activity can decrease or even stop. This is because extreme temperatures can cause the enzyme’s structure to denature, or lose its shape, which disrupts its ability to bind to substrates and catalyze reactions. <br> <br>

      Many enzymes require additional non-protein molecules called cofactors or coenzymes to be active. Cofactors are often metal ions like zinc, magnesium, or iron, which assist in the catalytic process. Coenzymes are organic molecules, often derived from vitamins, such as NAD+ or FAD, that bind to the enzyme and help transfer chemical groups during the reaction. For instance, vitamin B12 acts as a coenzyme in various important metabolic processes, including the synthesis of red blood cells and DNA. <br> <br>

      Some enzymes, known as extremozymes, are found in organisms that live in extreme conditions such as hot springs, deep-sea vents, or highly acidic environments. These extremozymes are adapted to function optimally under conditions that would denature most other enzymes. For example, Taq polymerase, an enzyme derived from the bacterium Thermus aquaticus that lives in hot springs, is used in PCR (polymerase chain reaction) to amplify DNA because it remains stable and active at high temperatures. <br> <br>

      Enzyme inhibitors are substances that can decrease or stop enzyme activity, and they play a crucial role in medicine. Some drugs are designed to act as enzyme inhibitors to treat diseases by blocking the activity of specific enzymes involved in disease processes. For example, aspirin works by inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, which are involved in inflammation and pain. By inhibiting these enzymes, aspirin reduces pain and inflammation, demonstrating how understanding enzyme function can lead to effective treatments. <br> <br>

      Enzymes are not static but evolve over time to adapt to new substrates or environmental conditions. This evolutionary flexibility allows organisms to develop new metabolic pathways or adapt to changes in their environment. For example, some bacteria have evolved enzymes that can degrade pollutants like oil or plastics, enabling them to survive in polluted environments. Studying these evolutionary adaptations provides insights into how life adapts to changing conditions and can inspire new biotechnological applications.
