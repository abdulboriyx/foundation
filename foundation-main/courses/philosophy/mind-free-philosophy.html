    <h2 class="mind-phil-header">What are determinism and free will in metaphysics?</h2>
    <p class="mind-phil-text">
    <b>Determinism</b> is the philosophical idea that every event or state of affairs, including every human decision and action, is the inevitable result of preceding events or states of affairs. In simpler terms, determinism suggests that everything that happens has a cause or causes that necessitate its occurrence, and these causes can be traced back through a chain of events.Imagine a row of dominoes standing upright. If you push the first domino, it will fall and knock over the second one, which then knocks over the third, and so on. In this scenario, each domino falling is determined by the preceding domino fallingâ€”it's a chain reaction that unfolds predictably based on the initial action of pushing the first domino. Similarly, determinism posits that every action, choice, or event in the world is like a domino in this chain, influenced by prior causes and leading inevitably to subsequent effects.

    <b>Free Will</b> is the philosophical concept that individuals have the capacity to make choices and decisions independently of deterministic forces or external constraints. It suggests that human beings possess the agency to act according to their own volition, guided by personal desires, beliefs, and values.
    Consider a scenario where you have to choose between studying for an exam or going out with friends. Free will asserts that you have the freedom to decide based on your preferences and priorities, without being solely determined by factors like peer pressure or external circumstances.
    Free will emphasizes the ability to make conscious choices that are not predetermined by factors beyond one's control. It contrasts with determinism, which proposes that every event, including human actions, is causally determined by preceding factors. Free will allows individuals to exercise autonomy in decision-making, reflecting personal motivations and intentions.

  <h2 class="mind-phil-header">
    Why are determinism and free will essential?
  </h2>

  <p class="mind-phil-text">
    <b> Cause and Effect:</b> Determinism helps us grasp the idea that every event, including human actions, has prior causes that lead to its occurrence. For instance, in historical analysis, understanding the socio-economic conditions that led to major political revolutions illustrates determinism in action.
    <br> <br>

    <b>Predictive Power:</b> By recognizing patterns of cause and effect, determinism allows us to predict outcomes based on existing conditions. For example, in economics, understanding market trends and consumer behavior enables forecasts that guide business decisions.
    <br> <br>

    <b>- Personal Agency and Responsibility:</b> Studying free will explores the concept that individuals have the ability to make choices that are not entirely determined by external factors. For example, deciding to pursue higher education or start a business reflects personal autonomy and the exercise of free will.

    Types of Determinism and Free Will
  </h2>

  <!-- Causal Determinism -->
  <div class="regularity-container">
    <h2 class="mind-phil-header">
      Causal Determinism
    </h2>
<p class="mind-phil-text">
  Causal determinism asserts that every event, including human actions, is determined by preceding events or causes. When a seed is planted in fertile soil and provided with water and sunlight, its growth into a plant is determined by these causal factors. The sequence of events leading to the plant's growth follows a predictable chain of cause and effect.

  <!-- Logical Determinism  -->
<div class="logical-determinism-container">
  <h2 class="mind-phil-header">
    Logical Determinism
  </h2>
  <p class="mind-phil-text">
    Logical determinism suggests that events are determined by the laws of logic and reasoning, independent of physical causation.
    Example: In logic, if it is true that all humans are mortal, and if it is also true that Socrates is a human, then logically, it follows that Socrates must be mortal. This sequence of reasoning demonstrates how logical principles can determine outcomes.

</div>
  <!-- Theological Determinism  -->
<div class="logical-determinism-container">
  <h2 class="mind-phil-header">
   Theological Determinism
  </h2>
  <p class="mind-phil-text">
    Theological determinism posits that events, including human choices, are predetermined by a divine being or supernatural force. In some religious beliefs, it is held that human destinies are preordained by God's will. For instance, the concept of predestination in certain interpretations of Christianity suggests that God has already determined who will be saved and who will not, regardless of individual actions.

  <!-- Compatibilism  -->
<div class="compatibilism-container">
  <h2 class="mind-phil-header">
    Compatibilism
  </h2>
  <p class="mind-phil-text">
    Compatibilism reconciles determinism with free will, asserting that free will is compatible with the idea that events are causally determined by preceding factors. You may have the freedom to choose whether to go for a walk or read a book on a sunny day. Even though your decision is influenced by factors like weather and mood (deterministic factors), compatibilism argues that as long as you make the choice according to your desires and reasons, it can be considered an exercise of free will.

  </p>

</div>


  <!-- Libertarianism  -->
<div class="libertarianism-container">
  <h2 class="mind-phil-header">
    Libertarianism
  </h2>
  <p class="mind-phil-text">
    Libertarianism asserts that free will exists independently of determinism, suggesting that individuals have the ability to make choices that are not entirely determined by prior causes. In libertarianism, your decision to pursue a career in art instead of medicine can be seen as an expression of free will. Even though societal expectations and economic factors may influence your decision, libertarianism emphasizes your capacity to make choices based on personal preferences and values

  <!-- Hard Determinism  -->
<div class="hard-determinism-container">

   Hard Determinism
  </h2>
  <p class="mind-phil-text">
    Hard determinism argues that all actions and events, including human decisions, are determined by prior causes, thereby denying the existence of genuine free will. According to hard determinism, even complex decisions like whether to relocate for a job are ultimately determined by factors such as upbringing, genetics, and environmental influences. Individuals do not possess the ability to make choices independent of these deterministic factors, as all events are predetermined by prior causes.

  Historically Notable Works on Causality
  </h2>
  <div class="historical-container">
  <ol class="source-knowledge">
    <li class="mind-list">
      <b>- Thomas Hobbes - "Leviathan" (1651):</b> In "Leviathan," Thomas Hobbes argues for a deterministic view of human behavior. He suggests that all human actions are determined by desires, fears, and external factors. This work is notable because it presents a mechanistic view of human nature where free will is seen as an illusion.
    </li>

    <li class="mind-list">
    <b>- David Hume - "An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding" (1748):</b>
    Hume explores the problem of causation and argues against the existence of necessary connections between events. He suggests that our belief in causation is based on observed patterns rather than inherent necessity. This work challenges deterministic views by highlighting the limits of human understanding in predicting or controlling events.
    </li>

    <li class="mind-list">
    <b>- Immanuel Kant - "Critique of Pure Reason" (1781)</b>  Kant distinguishes between phenomena (things as they appear to us) and noumena (things as they are in themselves). He argues that while determinism may apply to phenomena, our moral experience necessitates the assumption of free will. Kant's reconciliation attempts to preserve both deterministic laws of nature and the possibility of moral responsibility.
    </li>

    <li class="mind-list">
    <b>- Jean-Paul Sartre - "Being and Nothingness" (1943):</b>  Sartre argues for existentialist views on free will, emphasizing that individuals are radically free to choose their actions. He rejects determinism and asserts that human beings are condemned to be free, meaning they must take responsibility for their choices despite not being able to escape their freedom. This work is notable for its existentialist challenge to deterministic philosophies.

  <!-- Conceptual Clarity -->
  <div class="individuation-neccesities">
  <h2 class="mind-phil-header">
   Conceptual Clarity
  </h2>
<p class="mind-phil-text">
  The definition of free will itself is often debated. Some argue that for free will to exist, humans must have the ability to make choices independent of external influences or prior causes (libertarian free will). Others suggest that free will can coexist with determinism if understood as the ability to act according to one's desires and reasons (compatibilist free will). Without a clear definition of free will, it's challenging to determine whether it is compatible with determinism or not. This ambiguity complicates philosophical discussions and practical implications, such as moral responsibility.

<!-- Scientific and Philosophical Determinism -->
<div class="order-neccesities">
<h2 class="mind-phil-header">
  Scientific and Philosophical Determinism
</h2>
<p class="mind-phil-text">
  Scientific determinism posits that every event, including human actions, has a cause that precedes it and determines its occurrence. This view challenges the idea of free will because it suggests that our actions are predetermined by factors outside our control. If determinism is true, it raises questions about whether individuals can truly be held morally responsible for their actions if those actions are determined by prior causes. It also challenges the concept of personal autonomy and agency.

</p>
</div>

<!-- Compatibilism -->
<div class="phil-dispute">
  <h2 class="mind-phil-header">
   Compatibilism
  </h2>

  <p class="mind-phil-text">
    Compatibilism attempts to reconcile determinism with free will by arguing that free will is compatible with the causal determinism of natural laws. However, critics argue that this approach may water down the concept of free will to be consistent with deterministic views. Critics question whether compatibilist free will adequately captures the intuitive sense of freedom necessary for moral responsibility and personal autonomy. They argue that if our actions are fully determined by prior causes, even if we act according to our desires and reasons, it may not qualify as genuine free will.
