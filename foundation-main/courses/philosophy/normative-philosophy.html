    <h2 class="normative-phil-header">What are normative ethics?</h2>
    <p class="normative-phil-text">
      Normative ethics is a branch of ethical theory concerned with establishing norms or principles that determine what actions are morally right or wrong, good or bad. Unlike metaethics, which explores the nature and origins of ethical concepts, and applied ethics, which addresses specific moral issues in practical contexts, normative ethics aims to provide general guidelines for moral conduct. It seeks to answer fundamental questions about how individuals should behave and make decisions in morally complex situations. <br> <br>

      <!-- Why do normative ethics matter? -->
<div class="neccesities-container">
  <h2 class="normative-phil-header">
    Why are normative ethics essential?
  </h2>

  <p class="normative-phil-text">
    <b> - Foundation of Moral Reasoning:</b> Normative ethics provides a structured framework for evaluating moral dilemmas and making reasoned judgments about what is morally right or wrong. It introduces you to foundational theories such as utilitarianism, deontology, and virtue ethics, each offering different perspectives on ethical decision-making. By studying these theories, you develop critical thinking skills essential for analyzing complex moral issues.
    <br> <br>

    <b>- Ethical Decision-Making:</b> Understanding normative ethics equips you with tools to navigate real-world ethical challenges across various domains such as medicine, business, technology, and social policy. For instance, in medicine, you may encounter dilemmas about patient autonomy versus beneficence. Normative ethics helps you weigh conflicting moral principles and make informed decisions that align with ethical standards.
    <br> <br>

    <b>- Development of Moral Integrity:</b> Learning normative ethics fosters the cultivation of moral integrity and ethical awareness. It encourages you to reflect deeply on your values, principles, and responsibilities towards others. By grappling with ethical theories and applying them to practical scenarios, you enhance your ability to act ethically and responsibly in personal and professional contexts.

  <!-- Utilitarianism -->
  <div class="utilitarianism-container">
    <h2 class="normative-phil-header">
      Utilitarianism
    </h2>
<p class="normative-phil-text">
  Utilitarianism suggests that the right action is the one that produces the greatest amount of happiness or pleasure for the greatest number of people affected by the action. It's a consequentialist theory, meaning it evaluates actions based on their outcomes. <br> <br>

  Imagine a government policymaker deciding whether to allocate funds towards building new hospitals or sports stadiums. A utilitarian approach would argue for investing in hospitals because it maximizes overall happiness by improving public health and well-being, benefiting a larger number of people in the community.
<br>

  </div>

  <!-- Deontology  -->
<div class="deontology-container">
  <h2 class="normative-phil-header">
    Deontology
  </h2>
  <p class="normative-phil-text">
    Deontology, often associated with Immanuel Kant, emphasizes moral duties and rules as the foundation for ethical behavior. Unlike utilitarianism, which focuses on outcomes, deontology asserts that actions are inherently right or wrong based on adherence to moral principles, regardless of their consequences. <br> <br>
    Consider a scenario where a person is faced with the decision to lie to protect someone from harm. A deontological perspective would argue that lying is inherently wrong because it violates the moral principle of honesty, regardless of the potential positive outcomes of protecting someone.

  </p>

  <!-- Virtue Ethics  -->
<div class="virtue-ethics-container">
  <h2 class="normative-phil-header">
   Virtue Ethics
  </h2>
  <p class="normative-phil-text">
    Virtue ethics shifts the focus from actions themselves to the character and virtues of the moral agent. It emphasizes the development of moral character traits like honesty, courage, compassion, and fairness. Actions are judged based on whether they reflect these virtuous traits. <br> <br>

    In a workplace setting, a manager who consistently demonstrates fairness, integrity, and respect for employees embodies virtue ethics. Their decisions and actions are guided by these virtues, contributing to a positive work environment and fostering trust among team members.

  Historically Notable Works on Normative Ethics
  </h2>
  <div class="historical-container">
  <ol class="source-knowledge">
    <li class="normative-list">
      <b>- "Nicomachean Ethics" by Aristotle:</b>
      Aristotle's "Nicomachean Ethics" is one of the foundational texts in Western ethics. In this work, Aristotle explores the concept of eudaimonia (human flourishing or happiness) and the virtues necessary for achieving it. He introduces virtue ethics, emphasizing the importance of moral character and the development of virtuous habits. <br> <br>
      Aristotle discusses the virtue of courage, which he defines as the mean between recklessness and cowardice. This virtue is essential for navigating difficult situations with bravery while avoiding unnecessary risks.
    </li>

    <li class="normative-list">
    <b>- "Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals" by Immanuel Kant:</b>
    Kant's "Groundwork" is a key text in deontological ethics. Kant introduces the categorical imperative, a universal moral principle that guides ethical decision-making. This principle asserts that actions are morally right if they can be willed as a universal law without contradiction. <br> <br>

    Kant argues that lying is inherently wrong because if lying were universalized (everyone lied whenever convenient), it would undermine trust and communication, thereby contradicting itself as a moral principle.
    </li>

    <li class="normative-list">
    <b>- "Utilitarianism" by John Stuart Mill:</b>  Mill's "Utilitarianism" is a seminal work in consequentialist ethics. He expands on Jeremy Bentham's utilitarianism, arguing that actions are morally right if they produce the greatest happiness for the greatest number of people. <br> <br>
   Mill distinguishes between higher and lower pleasures, advocating for intellectual and moral virtues over mere physical pleasures. For instance, promoting education would lead to greater overall happiness by fostering intellectual growth and moral development in society.
    </li>

    <li class="normative-list">
    <b>- "Ethics" by Dietrich Bonhoeffer:</b>
    Bonhoeffer's "Ethics" is notable for its exploration of Christian ethics in the context of Nazi Germany. Written during his imprisonment, Bonhoeffer addresses the ethical challenges of resisting tyranny and the responsibilities of individuals in confronting injustice.
    <br> <br>
    Bonhoeffer introduces the concept of "costly grace," emphasizing the moral courage required to act ethically in difficult circumstances. He argues for active resistance against oppression, even at personal risk, as a moral imperative grounded in Christian ethics.

  <!-- Metaethical Disagreements -->
  <div class="metaethical-disagreements">
  <h2 class="normative-phil-header">
   Metaethical Disagreements
  </h2>
<p class="normative-phil-text">
  Metaethics explores the nature, justification, and meaning of ethical principles and judgments. Disagreements in metaethics can impact normative ethics by challenging the foundations of ethical theories themselves. For instance, debates over whether moral truths are objective or subjective (moral realism vs. moral relativism) can influence how normative ethical principles are formulated and applied.
<br> <br>
  Metaethical disagreements can create uncertainty about the validity and reliability of normative ethical theories. If foundational metaethical questions remain unresolved, it becomes challenging to establish robust normative principles that are widely accepted or applicable across different contexts.

<!--  Application to Complex Real World Issues -->

  Application to Complex Real World Issues
</h2>
<p class="normative-phil-text">
  Normative ethical theories are often developed in abstract or idealized contexts, which may not fully capture the complexities of real-world ethical dilemmas. Applying normative ethics to complex issues such as global climate change, artificial intelligence, or healthcare policies requires considering a wide range of factors, stakeholders, and consequences.
<br> <br>
  The applicability of normative ethical theories to real-world scenarios can be limited by their ability to address multifaceted ethical concerns and trade-offs. Complex issues may involve conflicting values, uncertainties about outcomes, and varying perspectives among stakeholders, making it difficult to derive clear ethical guidance from theoretical principles alone.

   Evolution on Moral Standards
  </h2>

  <p class="normative-phil-text">
    Moral standards and societal values evolve over time, reflecting changes in cultural, social, and historical contexts. Normative ethics must adapt to these evolving norms to remain relevant and effective in guiding ethical decision-making. However, differing interpretations and responses to moral progress can lead to debates over the legitimacy and appropriateness of established ethical norms.
    <br> <br>
    The dynamic nature of moral standards raises questions about the stability and universality of normative ethical principles. Shifts in societal attitudes or advancements in knowledge may challenge traditional ethical frameworks, requiring continuous reflection and adaptation of normative ethics to address contemporary ethical issues.
