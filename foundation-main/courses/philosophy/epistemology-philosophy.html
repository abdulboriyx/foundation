    <h2 class="epistemology-phil-header">What is epistemology?</h2>
    <p class="epistemology-phil-text">
      Epistemology is the branch of philosophy concerned with the study of knowledge, including its nature, sources, limits, and justification. It seeks to answer fundamental questions about what constitutes knowledge, how we acquire it, and how we can distinguish justified beliefs from mere opinions or false beliefs. By exploring these issues, epistemology aims to understand how we can know what we know and ensure that our beliefs are well-founded and reliable.

    Why does Epistemology matter?
  </h2>
  <p class="epistemology-phil-text">
    Epistemology matters because it helps us understand the nature and scope of knowledge, ensuring that our beliefs are justified and reliable. It provides the foundation for critical thinking, scientific inquiry, and rational decision-making by teaching us how to evaluate the validity of information and arguments. By addressing questions about the sources and limits of knowledge, epistemology equips us to navigate a complex world with clarity and reason, ultimately fostering intellectual humility and open-mindedness.

<!-- Nature of knowledge -->
<div class="nature-knowledge">
  <h2 class="epistemology-phil-header">
    Nature of Knowledge
  </h2>
<p class="epistemology-phil-text">
   The nature of knowledge, in epistemology, refers to the fundamental characteristics and criteria that distinguish knowledge from mere belief or opinion. It involves understanding what it means to truly know something, including the conditions under which a belief can be considered justified and reliable.

</p>

</div>

<!-- Belief -->
<div class="belief-container">
  <h2 class="epistemology-phil-header">Belief</h2>
  <p class="epistemology-phil-text">
In epistemology, belief is the mental acceptance or conviction that a proposition or statement is true or likely to be true. It is a cognitive state where an individual holds a position or attitude toward a claim, whether based on evidence, reasoning, testimony, intuition, or other factors.
  </p>

</div>

<!-- Truth -->
<div class="truth-container">
<h2 class="epistemology-phil-header">Truth</h2>
<p class="epistemology-phil-text">
  In epistemology, truth refers to the correspondence between a belief or statement and objective reality. It is the quality of being in accordance with facts or actuality, where a proposition is considered true if it accurately describes the way things are.
</p>
</div>

<!-- Justification -->
<div class="justification-container">
  <h2 class="epistemology-phil-header">Justification</h2>
<p class="epistemology-phil-text"> In epistemology, justification refers to the process or reasons that support the belief in a proposition or claim. It involves providing evidence, reasons, or arguments that make a belief reasonable, rational, or justified. Justification is crucial because it distinguishes knowledge from mere opinion or belief by establishing a basis for why a belief is considered reliable or well-founded.

<!-- Brief history  -->

<div class="history-container">
  <h2 class="epistemology-phil-header">
    Brief History of Epistemology
  </h2>
<ol class="phil-list">


  <li class="epistemology-phil-text">
    <b>Ancient Greece</b>: Picture Plato and Socrates in togas, having deep chats in the marketplace. Plato kicked things off by saying, "Knowledge is justified true belief," and Socrates, always the troublemaker, kept asking annoying questions like, "But how do we really know that we know?" These guys were the OG knowledge detectives.
  </li>

<!-- Medieval philosophy -->

  <li class="epistemology-phil-text">
    <b>Middle Ages</b>: Fast forward to the medieval times, where philosophers tried to mix faith and reason like an awkward cocktail. Think of Aquinas, juggling Aristotle's ancient wisdom with church doctrines, all while wearing a robe that probably itched a lot.
  </li>

<!-- Early Modern Philosophy -->

  <li class="epistemology-phil-text">
<b>Rationalism vs. Empiricism</b>: Enter the Renaissance and Enlightenment, the ultimate showdown between the rationalists and the empiricists. Rationalists like Descartes declared, "I think, therefore I am," basically saying that you can think your way to knowledge. Meanwhile, empiricists like Locke and Hume were shouting, "Show me the evidence!" claiming that knowledge comes from our senses. It was like a philosophical version of a rap battle, but with more powdered wigs and less beatboxing.
  </li>

<!-- Modern and contemporary -->


  <li class="epistemology-phil-text">
    <b>Immanuel Kant</b>:
   Along came Kant, who decided to play peacemaker. He proposed that our minds come pre-equipped with some knowledge and that experience shapes the rest. He basically said, "Can't we all just get along?" and tried to unite the battling factions with his theory of synthetic a priori knowledge, which is as complicated as it sounds.

    Key Terms in Epistemology
  </h2>
  <ol class="source-knowledge">
    <li class="epistemology-list">
      <b>- A priori:</b> Knowledge that is independent of experience, typically derived through reason alone. Examples include mathematical truths (e.g., 2 + 2 = 4) and certain logical propositions (e.g., all bachelors are unmarried).
    </li>

    <li class="epistemology-list">
      <b>- A posteriori:</b> Knowledge that depends on experience or empirical evidence. It is acquired through observation, experimentation, or sensory perception. Examples include scientific observations (e.g., water boils at 100 degrees Celsius) and historical facts (e.g., the Battle of Waterloo occurred in 1815).
    </li>

    <li class="epistemology-list">
      <b>- Empiricism:</b> The philosophical theory that all knowledge originates from sensory experience. Empiricists emphasize the role of observation, experimentation, and empirical evidence in acquiring knowledge about the world.
    </li>

    <li class="epistemology-list">
      <b>- Rationalism:</b> The philosophical theory that reason and rationality are the primary sources of knowledge. Rationalists argue that certain truths can be known independently of experience through innate reasoning or intuition.
    </li>

    <li class="epistemology-list">
      <b>- Foundationalism:</b> The epistemological theory that basic beliefs or foundational beliefs serve as the justification for all other beliefs. Foundationalists argue that some beliefs are self-evident or indubitable and provide the secure foundation upon which knowledge is built.
    </li>

    <li class="epistemology-list">
      <b>- Coherentism:</b> The epistemological theory that beliefs are justified by their coherence with other beliefs within a comprehensive system. Coherentists emphasize the consistency and logical coherence among a set of beliefs rather than relying on foundational or basic beliefs.
    </li>
  </ol>
