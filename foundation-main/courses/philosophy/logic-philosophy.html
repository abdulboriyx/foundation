    <h2 class="logic-phil-header">What is logic?</h2>
    <p class="logic-phil-text">
      In philosophy, it is defined as the branch of reasoning that relates to the analysis of characteristics that defines the distinctions between sound and unsound reasoning. They are two ways of approaching or viewing logic: as constructing the right sort of arguments, and as the proper assessment of whether one argument necessarily leads to a new one.
      <br>
      Definition: In philosophy, logic is all about analysis of rules of inference, validity and consistency of the particular argument. It endeavours to define what constitutes sound thinking and draws a clear line between instances of bad or unsound thinking and sound thinking.


</p>

    <p class="logic-phil-text">
      Suppose you are choosing between going to a friend’s outdoor birthday party or not. Your decision hinges on two premises you've set for yourself: First of all, yes, if the weather is good, specifically if the weather is sunny, then you will go to that party. Secondly, this is where you open the website on which you have the weather application, and ensure it is actually sunny today. Using deduction you deduce that you would go for the party because the required premise you laid down (sunny weather) has been met. In this quite simple example one can observe how logic works in the everyday life and in the philosophy. But it is rather concerned with rationality and logical links of its premises and the decisions made on the basis of such logic. This way, you guarantee that your decision making is rational and based upon the information which is at your disposal thus making decision – making easier in a range of circumstances.

  <p class="logic-phil-text">
   Logic matters for the following reasons:

    <ol class="source-logic">
      <!-- Sound Reasoning -->
      <li class="logic-list">
        <b>- Sound Reasoning:</b>
        It insulates the process of thinking by requiring that the reached conclusions be based on proper set of premises. In subjects such as science, law as well as ethics, the use of logic in arriving at a decision as well as in being able to arrive at conclusions based on facts as well as set principles is helpful.

        </li>


        <!-- Clarity and Precision -->
        <li class="logic-list">
        <b>-  Clarity and Precision:</b> Logic increases the accuracy and specific in both, oral and written communication and in thinking. It assists in formulating certain propositions in a manner that is easy to comprehend and outlining the requirements in order to avoid fallacies or erred reasoning.
        </li>

        <!-- Problem Solving -->
        <li class="logic-list">
          <b>- Problem Solving:</b> Logic is useful in problem-solving because giant problems are dissected into parts, and the mind looks for rational ways of solving problems. When it comes to professional disciplines in mathematics, computer science, and even engineering, the ability to think logically is unattestable when it comes to creating programs, proving theorems, or enhancing strategies.

   Propositions & Statements
  </h2>
  <p class="logic-phil-text">
    A proposition is a statement of a general assertive nature that provides declaration in the form of clear and specific truth assertion that has the possibility of being either true or false. It is an expression of an opinion either in the affirmative or in the negative of something in the world. Historically, propositions can be expressed with declarative sentences since the act of logical categorization usually involves propositions. For instance:
    <ol class="source-logic">
      <li class="logic-list source-list">
        - Proposition: "The Earth orbits the Sun."
      </li>

      <p class="logic-phil-text">
        This is a statement about how the earth and the sun are col linear and thus provides a definite statement. It may be considered as either true or false depending on the rational statement of facts.
      </p>

    </ol>
  </p>

<p class="logic-phil-text">
  Statements are linguistic statements that can be true or false. In logic, words are often used interchangeably with propositions to express meaningful information about the world or to express facts.
  <ol class="source-logic">
<li class="logic-list source-list">
  Statement: "It is raining outside."
</li>
  </ol>
  <p class="logic-phil-text">
    This sentence asserts a fact about the weather. It can be true if it is actually raining outside, or false if it is not.

<!-- Types of Logic -->
<div class="type-logic-container">
  <h2 class="logic-phil-header">Types of Logic</h2>
<p class="logic-phil-text">



</p>

<p class="logic-phil-text">
 <b> Categorical Propositions:</b> Categorical propositions categorically assert relationships between classes or categories of things. They typically use universal quantifiers like "all" or "no" to describe the entirety or absence of membership within a class. For example, consider the proposition "All birds have wings." This statement asserts that every member of the class "birds" possesses the characteristic of having wings. Conversely, the proposition "No mammals lay eggs" categorically denies the possibility of any member of the class "mammals" laying eggs. Categorical propositions are essential in defining clear boundaries and relationships between different classes of objects or entities.
</p>

<p class="logic-phil-text">
 <b> Disjunctive Propositions:</b> Disjunctive propositions present alternatives or choices where at least one option must be true. They typically use the word "or" to connect different statements. For instance, consider the proposition "Either John will go to the concert, or Sarah will go." This statement presents two possible scenarios, asserting that at least one of them will occur. Disjunctive propositions are useful in decision-making processes and in outlining possible outcomes based on different conditions or choices.
</p>


<p class="logic-phil-text">
 <b> Conditional Propositions:</b> Conditional propositions express relationships between two statements, typically in an "if-then" format. They assert that if a certain condition (the antecedent) is true, then a consequent statement will also be true. For example, consider the proposition "If it rains, then the ground will be wet." This statement asserts a causal relationship where rain (the antecedent) leads to wet ground (the consequent). Conditional propositions are crucial in modeling cause-and-effect relationships and predicting outcomes based on specific conditions.
</p>

<p class="logic-phil-text">
  <b>Existential Propositions:</b> Existential propositions assert the existence of at least one thing possessing a certain property. They typically use existential quantifiers like "there exists" to denote the presence of something. For instance, consider the proposition "There exists a black swan." This statement affirms that at least one swan exists in the world that is black, challenging the previous belief that all swans were white. Existential propositions are important in affirming the reality or existence of entities or phenomena based on observable evidence or logical deduction.
</p>


<!-- Truth table -->
<div class="truth-container">
<h2 class="logic-phil-header">
Truth Table
</h2>
<p class="logic-phil-text">
  A truth table is a systematic way of representing the truth values of logical propositions or statements based on all possible combinations of their constituent variables. It shows the possible truth values of the propositions for every possible scenario, helping to determine the overall truth value of compound statements in logic.

<!-- Argument -->
<div class="argument-container">
  <div class="argument-intro">
    <!-- What is argument? -->
<h2 class="logic-phil-header">
  Argument
</h2>

<p class="logic-phil-text">
  An argument in logic is a set of statements where one or more statements (premises) are put forward as reasons to support another statement (the conclusion). The premises are intended to provide logical support or evidence for the truth of the conclusion. The validity of an argument is determined by whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises. For instance:
  <ol class="source-logic">

    <li class="logic-list">
      Premise 1: All humans are mortal. (P1)
    </li>

    <li class="logic-list">
      Premise 2: Socrates is a human. (P2)
    </li>

    <li class="logic-list">
      Conclusion: Therefore, Socrates is mortal. (C)
    </li>
  </ol>
</p>
</div>

<!-- Types of arguments -->
<div class="argument-types">
<h2 class="logic-phil-header">
  Types of Arguments
</h2>
<!-- Deductive Argument -->
<div class="deductive-argument">
<h2 class="logic-phil-header">Deductive argument</h2>
<p class="logic-phil-text">
  A deductive argument is one in which the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. If the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true.
  For instance:

<ol class="source-logic">
  <li class="logic-list source-list">
   - Premise 1: All mammals have lungs. (P1)
  </li>

 <li class="logic-list source-list">
 - Premise 2: A whale is a mammal. (P2)
  </li>

  <li class="logic-list source-list">
   - Conclusion: Therefore, a whale has lungs. (C)
  </li>
</ol>
</p>
</div>

<!-- Inductive Argument -->
<div class="inductive-argument">
<h2 class="logic-phil-header">Inductive Argument</h2>
<p class="logic-phil-text">
  An inductive argument is one where the conclusion is supported by the premises, but the truth of the conclusion is probable rather than certain. Inductive arguments are based on observations and evidence.
  <ol class="source-logic">
    <li class="logic-list souce-list">
      Premise 1: Every time I've eaten strawberries, they have been sweet. (P1)
    </li>

    <li class="logic-list souce-list">
      Conclusion: Therefore, the strawberries I'm about to eat will probably be sweet. (C)
    </li>
  </ol>

<p class="logic-phil-text">
  This inductive argument suggests that based on past experiences (P1), it is likely that the strawberries I'm about to eat will be sweet (C). However, unlike deductive arguments, the conclusion is not guaranteed; it is based on probability.
</p>

</p>
</div>

<!-- Abductive Argument -->
<div class="abductive-argument">
<h2 class="logic-phil-header">Abductive Argument</h2>
<p class="logic-phil-text">
  An abductive argument is one where the conclusion is inferred as the best explanation for the observed facts or evidence. It is often used in scientific reasoning and problem-solving.
  <ol class="source-logic">
    <li class="logic-list source-list">
      - Premise 1: The ground is wet outside. (P1)
    </li>


    <li class="logic-list source-list">
      - Premise 2: It rained heavily last night. (P2)
    </li>


    <li class="logic-list source-list">
      - Conclusion: Therefore, the ground is wet because it rained last night. (C)
    </li>
  </ol>
</p>


</div>
</div>

<!-- Validity and Soundess of Argument -->
<div class="validity-soundness">
  <!-- Validity -->
  <h2 class="logic-phil-header">Validity</h2>
<p class="logic-phil-text">
  Validity refers to the property of an argument where the conclusion logically follows from the premises. In other words, if the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true. A valid argument has a structure that ensures if the premises are true, the conclusion cannot be false.
  <ol class="source-logic">
    <li class="logic-list source-list">
      - Premise 1: All humans are mortal. (P1)
    </li>

    <li class="logic-list source-list">
      - Premise 2: Socrates is a human. (P2)
    </li>

    <li class="logic-list source-list">
      - Conclusion: Therefore, Socrates is mortal. (C)
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p class="logic-phil-text">
    In this deductive argument, if we accept that all humans are mortal (P1) and Socrates is indeed a human (P2), then it logically follows that Socrates must be mortal (C). The conclusion follows necessarily from the premises, making this argument valid. <br>
    The validity of the argument is determined by its logical structure. Even if the conclusion were false (which it isn't in this case), the argument would still be valid as long as the conclusion follows logically from the premises.
  </p>
</p>

<!-- Soundness -->
<h2 class="logic-phil-header">Soundness</h2>
<p class="logic-phil-text">
  Soundness goes a step further than validity. A sound argument is not only valid (where the conclusion logically follows from the premises) but also has true premises. In other words, for an argument to be sound, it must be valid, and all of its premises must be true.

  <ol class="source-logic">
<li class="logic-list source-list">
 - Premise 1: All mammals have lungs. (P1)
</li>

<li class="logic-list source-list">
- Premise 2: A whale is a mammal. (P2)
</li>

<li class="logic-list source-list">
  Conclusion: Therefore, a whale has lungs. (C)
</li>
  </ol>

  <p class="logic-phil-text">
    This argument is both valid (the conclusion follows logically from the premises) and sound because both premises are true (P1 is a generally accepted biological fact, and P2 is true according to scientific classification). <br> <br>
    Soundness ensures not only that the argument is valid (logically correct) but also that it is based on true premises. A sound argument is considered strong and reliable because it guarantees both logical coherence and factual accuracy.

<!-- Fallacies of Logic -->
<div class="fallacies-container">
<h2 class="logic-phil-header">
  Logic Fallacies
</h2>

<!-- Ad Hominem -->
<p class="logic-phil-text">
<b>Ad Hominem:</b> This fallacy occurs when someone attacks the person making the argument rather than addressing the argument itself. For example, if someone says, "You shouldn't listen to John's advice on finance because he's terrible with money himself," they are attacking John personally instead of critiquing his financial advice.
</p>

<!-- Straw Man -->
<p class="logic-phil-text">
<b>Straw Man:</b> In this fallacy, someone misrepresents their opponent's argument to make it easier to attack. Instead of addressing the actual argument, they attack a weaker version of it. For instance, if someone argues, "We should improve funding for public schools," and their opponent responds, "They just want to raise taxes and waste more money," they are creating a distorted or "straw man" version of the original argument.
</p>

<!-- False Cause -->
<p class="logic-phil-text">
  <b>False Cause:</b> Also known as post hoc ergo propter hoc (Latin for "after this, therefore because of this"), this fallacy assumes that because one event happened after another, the first event must have caused the second. For example, if someone says, "I wore my lucky socks and aced the exam, so my socks must be lucky," they are implying a causal connection between wearing the socks and their success without considering other factors.
</p>

<!-- Appeal to Authority -->
<p class="logic-phil-text">
  <b>Appeal to Authority:</b> Also known as post hoc ergo propter hoc (Latin for "after this, therefore because of this"), this fallacy assumes that because one event happened after another, the first event must have caused the second. For example, if someone says, "I wore my lucky socks and aced the exam, so my socks must be lucky," they are implying a causal connection between wearing the socks and their success without considering other factors.
</p>

<!-- Circular Reasoning -->
<p class="logic-phil-text">
<b>Circular Reasoning:</b> This fallacy happens when the conclusion of an argument is assumed in one of the premises. Essentially, the argument goes in a circle without providing new information to support the conclusion. For example, if someone argues, "The Bible is true because it is the word of God, and we know it is the word of God because the Bible says so," they are using circular reasoning.

  <!-- Self-refuting Argument -->
  <div class="certainty-logic">
  <h2 class="logic-phil-header">
    The Self-Refutation Argument:
  </h2>
<p class="logic-phil-text">
  The skeptics opponents claimed that logic though being logically positive was self-refuting. To that, those skeptics who say that we cannot know anything must be told that their own claim falls under the things they claim not to be able to know. This paradox means that the statement saying that there is no knowledge, denies it at the same time since it is based on knowledge to say so.

<!-- The Practical Necessity Argument:  -->
<div class="practical-untenable-logic">
<h2 class="logic-phil-header">
  The Practical Necessity Argument:
</h2>
<p class="logic-phil-text">
  The opponents also argue that logic cannot work and does not fit the real world. This would be true, but every person, even a skeptic, must presuppose something in order to exist and perform the tasks of everyday life. For instance, they rely on feeling to shun risks or to converse with other individuals. This argument suggests that if the skeptical approach is put into use who will act or rather who will move a muscle, this is due to the fact that skeptics see all actions as futile.

    The Reliability of Cognitive Faculties
  </h2>
  <p class="logic-phil-text">
    Yet, another reason given in support of anti-logic is based on the postulate of the general trustworthiness of our cognitive processes. This view, which is tied to various degrees of epistemological reliabilism, is the notion that our senses, and thought processes are for the most part reliable in giving us the truth about reality. Although mistakes are sometimes made, the general ability of human beings to get around and make sense of the world around them in effect bolsters the reliability of the mental assets that people possess to allow for the acquisition of useful and true knowledge.
