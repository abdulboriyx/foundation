    <h2 class="intro-phil-header">What is philosophy?</h2>
    <p class="intro-phil-text">
      Philosophy is the systematic study of fundamental questions concerning existence, knowledge, reason, ethics, and the nature of reality. It seeks to understand the world through reasoned inquiry and critical analysis, exploring topics that range from the nature of consciousness to the principles governing human behavior and the cosmos. Philosophy does not provide definitive answers but rather encourages rigorous examination and debate, aiming to uncover deeper truths about the human experience and the universe we inhabit.

   Why do we learn philosophy?
  </h2>

<p class="intro-phil-text">
  Ah, why learn philosophy, you ask? Well, who wouldn’t want to delve into the ancient mysteries of thought and existence, grappling with questions that have perplexed the greatest minds for centuries? Imagine the thrill of spending your days deciphering dense texts written in languages long forgotten, all to uncover truths that may or may not be relevant to your daily life. Philosophy isn’t just about questioning reality; it’s about questioning why you’re questioning reality in the first place. Because let’s face it, while everyone else is busy learning practical skills, you’ll be here pondering the very fabric of reality itself. Who needs a clear career path when you can have an existential crisis instead? And hey, once you’ve mastered the art of debating the nature of truth over a latte, you’ll never look at a Starbucks cup the same way again. So, grab your ancient Greek dictionary and get ready to philosophize your way to a deeper understanding of... well, something.

  <h2 class="intro-phil-header">
    Brief History of Philosophy
  </h2>
<ol class="phil-list">

  <!-- Ancient Greek -->
  <h2 class="intro-phil-list-header">
    Ancient Philosophy: (c. 600 BCE - 500 CE)
  </h2>
  <li class="intro-phil-text">
    <b>Greek Thinkers</b>: Imagine ancient Greeks lounging around in togas, pondering life's mysteries like whether Zeus is really just a glorified thundercloud. Socrates starts asking annoyingly profound questions, Plato writes dialogues where everyone argues but no one pays for their meals, and Aristotle organizes everything into neat categories, even though life is anything but neat.
  </li>

<!-- Medieval philosophy -->
  <h2 class="intro-phil-list-header">
    Medieval Philosophy: (c. 500 - 1500 CE)
  </h2>
  <li class="intro-phil-text">
    <b>Scholastic Debates</b>: Picture monks in dimly lit libraries debating how many angels can dance on the head of a pin. Aquinas tries to merge faith and reason like peanut butter and jelly, while Islamic philosophers are busy preserving ancient wisdom and inventing algebra. Meanwhile, Europe is caught up in a philosophical tug-of-war between Aristotle and whatever the Church says this week.
  </li>

<!-- Early Modern Philosophy -->
  <h2 class="intro-phil-list-header">
    Early Modern Philosophy: (c. 1500 - 1800 CE)
  </h2>
  <li class="intro-phil-text">
<b>Enlightenment</b>:  The Renaissance brings back Greco-Roman swag, and suddenly everyone wants to be a philosopher, or at least paint like one. Descartes decides to doubt everything, including whether he's actually awake (spoiler: he's not sure). Locke argues that we're all born with a blank slate, while Kant decides to put the "meta" in metaphysics by asking what's really real when no one's looking.
  </li>

<!-- Modern and contemporary -->
  <h2 class="intro-phil-list-header">
    Modern and Contemporary Philosophy: (c. 1800 CE - Present)
  </h2>

  <li class="intro-phil-text">
    <b>Philosophical Renaissance</b>:
    Hegel tries to explain everything with a grand cosmic dance, Marx thinks everything's about class struggle, and Nietzsche declares that God is dead (probably because no one invited Him to the existentialist party). Meanwhile, analytic philosophers debate the meaning of "meaning," and existentialists ponder why we bother pondering at all.
  </li>


<!-- Contemporary philosophy -->
<h2 class="intro-phil-list-header">
  Contemporary Philosophy: (20th Century - Present)
</h2>

<li class="intro-phil-text">
<b>Postmodern Pickles</b>: Postmodernists decide truth is a social construct, deconstruct everything in sight, and leave us all wondering if we're reading philosophy or a choose-your-own-adventure novel. Pragmatists like Dewey are practical, telling us to stop philosophizing and just fix things, while philosophers of mind try to figure out why we think we know what we think we know.
</li>
</ol>

<!-- Branches of philosophy -->

      <div class="branch-container">
      <h2 class="intro-phil-header">Branches of philosophy</h2>

      <ol class="phil-list">
        <li class="intro-phil-text"><b>Metaphysics</b>: It’s like pondering the universe’s FAQs without a reliable customer support. Think about existence, reality, and why your cat sometimes acts like it's plotting your demise.</li>

        <li class="intro-phil-text"><b>Epistemology:</b> The study of knowledge and how we know stuff. Ever stayed up at night wondering if your dog understands quantum mechanics better than you? Epistemology's got your back.</li>

        <li class="intro-phil-text"><b>Ethics</b>: Figuring out if it’s morally acceptable to eat the last slice of pizza when no one’s looking. Also, debating whether it’s ethical to tell your friend their new haircut looks like a hedgehog.</li>

        <li class="intro-phil-text"><b>Logic</b>: The art of arguing so well, you can convince yourself that binge-watching Netflix is actually productive. Also, deducing why you always lose your keys but never your smartphone.</li>

        <li class="intro-phil-text"><b>Aesthetics</b>: Deciding whether that abstract painting in the museum is deep and meaningful or just a bunch of colorful squiggles. Also, contemplating why some people think avocado toast is an art form.</li>

        <li class="intro-phil-text"><b>Political philosophy</b>: Trying to solve world problems over brunch with friends, like whether pineapple belongs on pizza and if democracy is still cool.</li>

        <li class="intro-phil-text"><b>Philosophy of Mind</b>: Wondering if your brain is actually a complex computer or just a chaotic mess of thoughts, memes, and song lyrics from the 90s.</li>

        <li class="intro-phil-text"><b>Philosophy of Language</b>: Figuring out if a tree falling in the forest makes a sound if no one’s there to hear it, and if emojis count as a legitimate form of communication.
        </li>

        <li class="intro-phil-text"><b>Philosophy of Science</b>: Investigating whether scientists have discovered everything there is to know, or if there’s still room for a reality TV show about quantum mechanics.
        </li>

        <li class="intro-phil-text"><b>Existentialism</b>: Asking the big questions like why you're here, what's the meaning of life, and whether Mondays were invented by someone with a serious grudge against humanity.

        </li>
