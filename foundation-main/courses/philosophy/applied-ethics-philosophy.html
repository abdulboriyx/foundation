    <h2 class="applied-ethics-phil-header">What are applied ethics?</h2>
    <p class="applied-ethics-phil-text">

Applied ethics is the discipline of philosophy that attempts to apply ethical theory to real-life situations. It involves examining specific controversial issues, such as abortion, animal rights, or euthanasia, and using ethical principles and reasoning to determine the most morally appropriate stance and actions.
<br> <br>
One prominent example of applied ethics is medical ethics, which involves applying ethical principles to the field of medicine. A specific issue within medical ethics is euthanasia, or assisted dying.
<br> <br>
A terminally ill patient is experiencing unbearable pain, and despite all available treatments, their quality of life is deteriorating rapidly. The patient requests euthanasia to end their suffering.

<ol class="source-ethics">
  <li class="applied-ethics-list">
    <b>- Autonomy:</b> Respecting the patient's autonomy and their right to make decisions about their own life and body.
  </li>

  <li class="applied-ethics-list">
    <b>- Beneficence:</b> Considering whether euthanasia would be a compassionate act that alleviates suffering.
  </li>

  <li class="applied-ethics-list">
    <b>- Non-maleficence:</b> Weighing the principle of "do no harm" and determining whether allowing the patient to suffer constitutes more harm than euthanasia.
  </li>

  <li class="applied-ethics-list">
    <b>- Justice:</b> Ensuring fair access to euthanasia and considering the implications for society and legal systems.

<div class="essence-container">
  <h2 class="applied-ethics-phil-header">
    Why are applied ethics essential?
  </h2>

  <p class="applied-ethics-phil-text">
    <b> - Decision-making:</b> Applied ethics offers concrete guidelines to individuals and professionals facing complex moral decisions. By applying ethical theories to real-world situations, it helps in making informed, consistent, and justifiable choices. This is crucial in fields like medicine, law, business, and environmental policy, where decisions often have significant consequences. In healthcare, ethical frameworks assist doctors in making tough decisions about end-of-life care, balancing patient autonomy with professional responsibility and societal norms.
    <br> <br>

    <b>- Promoting Accountability and Integrity:</b>
    Applied ethics fosters accountability and integrity by establishing clear moral standards. This helps individuals and organizations maintain ethical behavior, build trust, and enhance their credibility. In business ethics, adhering to ethical guidelines can prevent fraud, corruption, and exploitation, thereby fostering a culture of honesty and responsibility within the organization.
    <br> <br>

    <b>- Enhancing Social Justice:</b>
    By addressing ethical issues in public policy and social practices, applied ethics contributes to the promotion of social justice. It helps identify and rectify injustices and inequalities in society. Applied ethics in law can guide the development of fair legal systems that protect human rights and ensure equitable treatment for all citizens.

      Social Contract Theory
    </h2>
<p class="applied-ethics-phil-text">
  Social contract theory, associated with philosophers like Thomas Hobbes, John Locke, and Jean-Jacques Rousseau, suggests that moral and political obligations are based on an implicit contract among individuals to form a society. It emphasizes mutual agreement and cooperation for the benefit of all.
    <br> <br>
  In environmental ethics, social contract theory might justify laws regulating pollution by arguing that individuals have consented, implicitly or explicitly, to rules that ensure the common good, including a healthy environment.

    Principlism, commonly used in bioethics, is based on four key principles: autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence, and justice. These principles provide a framework for ethical decision-making in medical contexts.

  Historically Notable Works on Applied Ethics
  </h2>
  <div class="historical-container">
  <ol class="source-knowledge">


    <li class="applied-ethics-list">
    <b>- "Utilitarianism" by John Stuart Mill (1863):</b>
    Mill's work is foundational for utilitarian ethics, which evaluates actions based on their consequences and aims to maximize overall happiness. This approach is highly influential in many areas of applied ethics, offering a clear method for evaluating the outcomes of different actions.
    Utilitarian principles are often applied in public policy and healthcare, such as in cost-benefit analysis for healthcare resource allocation, aiming to achieve the greatest good for the greatest number.
    </li>

    <li class="applied-ethics-list">
    <b>- "A Theory of Justice" by John Rawls (1971):</b>
    Rawls introduces the concepts of justice as fairness, the original position, and the veil of ignorance. His work has a significant impact on political and social ethics, providing a framework for evaluating the justice of social institutions and policies. Rawls's theories are used to address issues of social justice, such as fair distribution of resources and opportunities, and inform debates on economic inequality and social welfare policies.


    </li>

    <li class="applied-ethics-list">
    <b>-  "Principles of Biomedical Ethics" by Tom Beauchamp and James Childress (1979):</b>
    This book introduced the principlism approach in bioethics, outlining four key principles: autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence, and justice. These principles provide a practical framework for addressing ethical issues in medical practice. The principles are widely applied in clinical settings to guide ethical decision-making, such as balancing patient autonomy with the need to provide beneficial and non-harmful medical treatments.

<!-- Obstacles and Concerns in Applied Ethics  -->

    Obstacles and Concerns in Applied Ethics
  </h2>

  <!-- Complexity and Context-sensitivity -->
  <div class="applied-ethics-disagreements">
  <h2 class="applied-ethics-phil-header">
   Complexity and Context-Sensitivity
  </h2>
<p class="applied-ethics-phil-text">
  One of the primary challenges in applied ethics is the complexity and context-sensitivity of real-world situations. Ethical issues often involve multiple stakeholders, conflicting interests, and unique circumstances that make it difficult to apply general ethical principles straightforwardly. The concern here is that ethical theories might oversimplify complex situations or fail to account for important contextual details, leading to inadequate or inappropriate ethical guidance.
  <br> <br>
  In healthcare, the principle of patient autonomy can conflict with the principle of beneficence when a patient refuses life-saving treatment. The context of the patientâ€™s cultural background, mental state, and personal values all play crucial roles in determining the ethically appropriate course of action.


</p>
</div>

<!--  Cultural and Moral Relativism -->
<div class="real-world-issues">
<h2 class="applied-ethics-phil-header">
  Cultural and Moral Relativism
</h2>
<p class="applied-ethics-phil-text">
  Different cultures and societies have varying moral beliefs and practices, leading to cultural and moral relativism. This diversity can make it challenging to establish universal ethical standards or apply ethical principles consistently across different contexts. The concern is that ethical relativism can lead to moral paralysis, where no action can be definitively judged as right or wrong, potentially allowing harmful practices to persist under the guise of cultural differences.
  <br> <br>
In international business ethics, practices considered acceptable in one culture, such as gift-giving, might be viewed as bribery in another. Navigating these differences while maintaining ethical integrity can be particularly challenging.

</p>
</div>

<!--Balancing Ethical Principles -->
<div class="evolution-moral">
  <h2 class="applied-ethics-phil-header">
    Balancing Ethical Principles
  </h2>

  <p class="applied-ethics-phil-text">
    Applied ethics often requires balancing competing ethical principles, such as autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence, and justice. These principles can sometimes conflict, making it difficult to determine the most ethically appropriate action. The concern is that without a clear hierarchy or method for resolving conflicts between principles, decision-makers might struggle to prioritize which principle should take precedence, leading to ethical dilemmas and potential inconsistencies.
    <br> <br>
    In environmental ethics, the principle of economic development might conflict with the principle of environmental preservation. Deciding whether to prioritize economic growth or environmental sustainability involves complex trade-offs and can lead to contentious ethical debates.
