    <h2 class="particular-phil-header">What are  particulars in metaphysics?</h2>
    <p class="particular-phil-text">
      Particulars are individual, distinct entities that exist in the world. They are specific objects or instances that cannot be duplicated or replicated exactly. Particulars are characterized by their unique set of properties and identity. Unlike universals, which can be instantiated in multiple entities (e.g., the color red, which can appear in many objects), particulars are singular and specific.
      <br>
      The Eiffel Tower in Paris is a particular. It is a unique structure with specific characteristics that distinguish it from all other towers and structures in the world. These characteristics include its design, location, history, and physical attributes. No other tower in the world is exactly like the Eiffel Tower in every detail.

      <!-- Why does particular matter? -->
<div class="particular-container">
  <h2 class="particular-phil-header">
    Why are particular essential?
  </h2>

  <p class="particular-phil-text">
    Particulars are essential in metaphysics because they provide the foundation for understanding the concrete, individual entities that make up our reality. They are the specific instances or objects that possess unique properties and identities, allowing us to distinguish one entity from another. By focusing on particulars, metaphysicians can address fundamental questions about identity, existence, and individuation. For instance, while universals such as "redness" or "beauty" describe general properties that multiple entities can share, it is the particulars—such as a specific red apple or a particular beautiful painting—that embody these properties in distinct and tangible ways. This focus on particulars helps bridge the gap between abstract concepts and the tangible world, providing a clearer understanding of how general properties manifest in specific instances.

      Concrete Particulars
    </h2>
    <p class="particular-phil-text">
      Concrete particulars are individual entities that exist in the physical, tangible world. They have a specific location in space and time and can be perceived by the senses.
      <br>
      A particular oak tree in Central Park. This oak tree is a distinct entity that occupies a specific spot in the park. It has characteristics such as height, leaf shape, and bark texture, which can be observed and measured. Other examples include a specific car in a parking lot, a single apple in a fruit basket, or a particular building in a city.

    Abstract Particular
  </h2>
  <p class="particular-phil-text">
    Abstract particulars, or tropes, are individual instances of properties that exist independently of physical form. They are specific manifestations of properties or qualities. <br> <br>
    The specific shade of red of a particular apple. This specific redness is a unique instance of the color red and can be distinguished from other shades of red. Another example is the unique melody of a song, which exists as a distinct pattern of notes and rhythms, independent of any physical medium.

  <p class="particular-phil-text">
    Substantial particulars are entities that exist independently and have their own essence or substance. They are the fundamental units of reality in many metaphysical theories.
    <br> <br>
    A specific person, such as Albert Einstein. Einstein is an independent entity with a unique identity and set of characteristics, such as his physical appearance, intellectual abilities, and historical contributions.

    Spatial particulars are specific instances or entities that occupy a particular location in space. They are distinct entities that can be pinpointed in a physical space. <br> <br>

Think of a spatial particular is a specific bench in a park. This bench is a distinct entity located at a precise spot within the park. It may have unique characteristics such as its design, color, and the wear and tear it has experienced over time. The bench exists at a particular location, and anyone visiting the park can identify and sit on this specific bench.

<!-- Substratum Theory -->
<div class="particular-container">
  <h2 class="particular-phil-header">
   Substratum Theory
  </h2>
  <p class="particular-phil-text">
    Substratum theory posits that particulars are composed of a substance (or substratum) that underlies and supports their properties. The substratum itself is propertyless but serves as the bearer of the object's characteristics. <br> <br>
    Consider a red apple. According to substratum theory, the apple has an underlying substratum that supports its properties like color (redness), shape (roundness), and texture (smoothness). The substratum itself is not red, round, or smooth, but it is what makes the apple a cohesive particular with these properties.

<!-- Bundle Theory -->
<div class="particulars-container">
  <h2 class="particular-phil-header">
    Bundle Theory
  </h2>
  <p class="particular-phil-text">
    Bundle theory argues that particulars are nothing more than bundles or collections of properties. There is no underlying substance; rather, the object is simply the set of properties it possesses. <br>  <br>
    A basketball is a bundle of properties such as roundness, orange color, and a certain texture. According to bundle theory, the basketball does not have an underlying substance; it is just the combination of these properties that makes it a particular object.

<!-- Trope Theory -->
<div class="trope-container">
  <h2 class="particular-phil-header">
    Trope Theory
  </h2>

  <p class="particular-phil-text">
    Trope theory suggests that particulars are composed of specific instances of properties called tropes. Each trope is a particular instance of a property, and the collection of these tropes constitutes the particular. <br> <br>
    A specific chair can be understood in terms of its individual tropes: the particular shade of brown of its wood, the particular firmness of its cushion, and the particular shape of its legs. These tropes together form the particular chair.

</div>

<!-- Bare Particulars Theory -->
<div class="bare-particular-container">
  <h2 class="particular-phil-header">
    Bare Particular Theory
  </h2>
  <p class="particular-phil-text">
    Bare particulars theory posits that particulars have a core, property-less entity that possesses properties. This core entity, the bare particular, is what gives the object its identity apart from its properties. <br> <br>
    A car can be seen as having a bare particular that possesses properties like color, size, and engine type. The bare particular itself has no properties but serves as the entity to which all these characteristics belong.

<div class="realism-container">
  <h2 class="particular-phil-header">
    Constituent Ontology
  </h2>

  <p class="particular-phil-text">
    Constituent ontology holds that particulars are composed of both a substratum and its properties as constituents. Properties are not external to the substratum but are part of its internal makeup. <br> <br>
    A tree's particular existence can be understood as consisting of the tree itself (substratum) and its properties like height, leafiness, and bark texture. These properties are internal constituents of the tree.

      <b>- Aristotle's "Categories"</b>: In this work, Aristotle presents his classification of all possible kinds of things that can be the subject or the predicate of a proposition. He identifies substance as the primary category of being, where individual substances (particulars) are primary entities that exist independently.
    </li>

    <li class="particular-list">
      <b>- John Locke's "An Essay Concerning Human Understanding": </b> Locke explores the nature of human knowledge and perception. He distinguishes between primary qualities (inherent in objects) and secondary qualities (dependent on perception), emphasizing how particular objects are perceived through their properties.

      <b>
        -David Hume's "A Treatise of Human Nature":</b>
      Hume argues against the existence of a core substance underlying properties, proposing that what we consider to be particulars are merely collections of sensory impressions and ideas.

    <li class="particular-list">
      <b>- Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz's "Monadology":</b>  Leibniz introduces the concept of monads as the fundamental, indivisible units of existence. Monads are unique, self-contained particulars that reflect the entire universe from their own perspective.

   Challenges & Problems of Particular

  <!-- The Problem of Individuation -->
  <div class="individuation-particular">
  <h2 class="particular-phil-header">
    Problem of Individuation:
  </h2>
<p class="particular-phil-text">
  The problem of individuation questions what makes a particular entity unique and identifiable. For example, two identical twins share many properties (such as appearance), but they are still considered distinct individuals. What is the criterion that makes one particular different from another when all observable properties are identical?
  <br>
  Critics argue that without a clear principle of individuation, the concept of particulars becomes ambiguous. If particulars are defined solely by their properties, then in cases of identical properties, distinguishing between individuals becomes problematic.

</p>
</div>

<!-- Bundle vs Substance Theory -->
<div class="bundle-particular">
<h2 class="particular-phil-header">Bundle Theory vs Substance Theory</h2>
<p class="particular-phil-text">
  Bundle theory posits that a particular is just a collection of properties with no underlying substance. Substance theory, on the other hand, suggests that properties inhere in a substance that constitutes the particular.
  <br>
  The bundle theory faces the criticism that it cannot adequately explain the unity of a particular. If a particular is just a collection of properties, what holds these properties together as one entity? Conversely, the substance theory is criticized for positing an underlying entity that is difficult to empirically verify and seems metaphysically obscure.

</div>

<!-- Problem of Change -->
<div class="change-determinism">
  <h2 class="particular-phil-header">
    Problem of Change
  </h2>

  <p class="particular-phil-text">
    The problem of change addresses how a particular can have different properties at different times yet remain the same entity. For instance, a tree may change from being green in the summer to brown in the autumn. Despite these changes, we still consider it the same tree.
    <br> <br>
    Critics argue that if a particular’s identity is tied to its properties, then a change in properties should imply a change in identity. This raises questions about the persistence of particulars over time and the coherence of their identity through change.
