    <h2 class="possibility-phil-header">What are possibilites and neccesities in metaphysics?</h2>
    <p class="possibility-phil-text">
      In metaphysics, possibility refers to the way things could potentially be. It is concerned with what could exist, happen, or be true, even if it is not the case in the actual world. Possibility encompasses everything that is not necessarily false or contradictory. Philosophers often discuss possibility in terms of possible worlds, which are complete and consistent ways the world might have been. Given a different set of biological or evolutionary circumstances, it is conceivable that humans could have evolved to breathe underwater. This scenario does not contradict the nature of beings or fundamental properties, making it metaphysically possible.
      <br>
      In metaphysics, necessity refers to the way things must be. It deals with what must exist, happen, or be true in all possible worlds. Necessity implies that certain truths or states of affairs are unavoidable or inevitable. Necessary propositions are those that hold true regardless of any conditions or circumstances.  Mathematical truths, such as "2 + 2 = 4," are necessarily true because their truth does not depend on any particular state of the world; they are true in every conceivable scenario.<br>

    Why are possibility and neccesity essential?
  </h2>

  <p class="possibility-phil-text">
    <b> Understanding Big Questions:</b>  Possibility and necessity help you think about fundamental questions like "What could exist?" and "What must be true?" These questions are at the heart of understanding reality and existence.
    <br> <br>

    <b>Improving Critical Thinking:</b> Learning about these concepts sharpens your reasoning skills. You learn to distinguish between what is merely possible and what is necessarily true, making your arguments stronger and more precise.
    <br> <br>

    <b>Exploring Different Scenarios:</b> Possibility allows you to imagine different worlds and situations. This can be useful in creative problem-solving and thinking about alternative outcomes in various fields, from science to everyday life.
    <br> <br>
    <b>Essential Truths:</b> Necessity deals with truths that are always true, no matter what. Understanding necessary truths helps you grasp the foundations of logic, mathematics, and science, where certain principles must hold in all cases.

  <div class="natural-neccesities">

      Logical Possibility
    </h2>
<p class="possibility-phil-text">
  Logical possibility refers to anything that does not involve a contradiction in terms. If a proposition or scenario can be conceived without contradicting itself, it is logically possible. This type of possibility is the broadest, encompassing any scenario that can be imagined without logical inconsistency. A world where humans have three arms is logically possible because there is no inherent contradiction in the concept. It might be biologically unusual, but it doesn’t violate the principles of logic.

    Physical Possibility
  </h2>
  <p class="possibility-phil-text">
    Physical possibility is constrained by the laws of nature as we understand them. A physically possible event or state of affairs is one that could occur in our universe given the current laws of physics. It is physically possible for a person to run a marathon. This event is consistent with the laws of biology and physics governing human physiology and the physical world.

    Metaphysical Possibility
  </h2>

  <p class="possibility-phil-text">
    Metaphysical possibility refers to what could exist or occur in the broadest sense, beyond just logical consistency. It takes into account the nature of entities and their essential properties. If something is metaphysically possible, it can exist or occur in some conceivable world where the entities’ essential properties remain consistent. A world where humans can live forever is metaphysically possible. It doesn't involve a logical contradiction and could be conceivable in a universe where the essential properties of human biology are different from those in our current world.

<!-- Logical Neccesity -->
<div class="logical-neccesities">
<h2 class="possibility-phil-header">
  Logical Neccesity
</h2>
<p class="possibility-phil-text">
  Logical necessity refers to statements or propositions that must be true in all possible worlds because their negation would result in a contradiction. These are truths that follow from the principles of logic and cannot be otherwise. The statement "All bachelors are unmarried men" is logically necessary. By definition, a bachelor is an unmarried man, so it is impossible for this statement to be false in any conceivable scenario.

    Physical Neccesity
  </h2>

  <p class="possibility-phil-text">
    Physical necessity pertains to events or states of affairs that must occur or be the case given the laws of nature. These are truths that are required by the actual physical laws governing our universe. It is physically necessary for water to freeze at 0 degrees Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit) under standard atmospheric pressure. This is dictated by the physical properties of water and the laws of thermodynamics.

<!-- Metaphysical Neccesity -->
<div class="metaphysical-neccesity-container">
  <h2 class="possibility-phil-header">
   Metaphysical Neccesity
  </h2>
  <p class="possibility-phil-text">
    Metaphysical necessity involves truths that are necessary in the broadest sense, encompassing the nature or essence of things. These necessities are not contingent on physical laws but on the very nature of existence and identity. It is metaphysically necessary that a triangle has three sides. In any possible world, if an entity is a triangle, it must have three sides. This is an essential property of triangles.

  Historically Notable Works on Possibility and Neccesity
  </h2>
  <div class="historical-container">
  <ol class="source-knowledge">
    <li class="possibility-list">
      <b>- Aristotle's "Metaphysics"</b>: Aristotle introduced the concepts of potentiality (what could be) and actuality (what is). This foundational distinction helps in understanding possibility and necessity. In "Metaphysics," Aristotle explains that an acorn has the potential (possibility) to become an oak tree, but it is not necessarily an oak tree until it actually grows into one. This example illustrates the difference between potential (possible) and actual (necessary) states.
    </li>

    <li class="possibility-list">
      <b>- Leibniz's "Theodicy": </b> Leibniz discusses the concept of possible worlds and argues that the actual world is the best possible one that God could have created. In "Theodicy," Leibniz uses the idea of possible worlds to argue that while many different worlds could have existed, the actual world is the best because it has the greatest balance of good over evil. This introduces the idea of evaluating possibilities to understand the necessity of the actual world.

    </li>

    <li class="possibility-list">
      <b>
        Kant's "Critique of Pure Reason":</b>
        Kant explores the nature of human understanding and the limits of what we can know about possibility and necessity. In "Critique of Pure Reason," Kant differentiates between a priori knowledge (knowledge that is necessary and independent of experience) and a posteriori knowledge (knowledge that is possible and dependent on experience). For instance, the statement "7 + 5 = 12" is necessarily true and known a priori, while "the sun rises in the east" is known through experience and thus a posteriori.
    </li>

    <li class="possibility-list">
      <b>- David Hume's "An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding":</b>  David Hume's "An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding" challenges traditional notions of causality and necessity. Hume argues that our ideas of necessity are derived from the habitual association of events rather than from any inherent connection in the events themselves. This skepticism towards necessary connections in nature has significant implications for understanding possibility and necessity.
    </li>

    <li class="possibility-list">
      <b>- David Hume's "An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding"</b> Hume challenges traditional notions of causality and necessity, arguing that our understanding of these concepts is based on habit and experience rather than logical necessity. In "An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding," Hume argues that we believe the sun will rise tomorrow because it has always done so in the past, not because it is necessarily true. This highlights the difference between believing something is necessary based on habit versus logical certainty.

  <!-- Could vs Must -->
  <div class="individuation-neccesities">
  <h2 class="possibility-phil-header">
    What Could Happend vs What Must Happen
  </h2>
<p class="possibility-phil-text">
  It’s challenging to clearly define the difference between things that could happen (possibilities) and things that must happen (necessities). Imagine you’re thinking about the future of technology. It’s possible that humans might build a colony on Mars, but it’s not necessary. Understanding that possibility does not mean it will definitely happen is important. This confusion can make it hard to understand and discuss what is truly possible versus what is inevitable. For instance, it’s necessary that water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius under standard conditions, but it’s only possible, not necessary, that humans might one day live on Mars.
</p>
</div>

<!-- Limited Knowledge -->
<div class="bundle-neccesities">
<h2 class="possibility-phil-header">
  Limited Knowledge about Possible
</h2>
<p class="possibility-phil-text">
  Our knowledge about the universe and the laws of nature is limited. In the past, people thought it was impossible to fly because they didn’t understand aerodynamics. Now, flying is a common mode of transportation. Because of this limited knowledge, it’s difficult to confidently say what is possible or necessary. We might think something is impossible just because we don’t understand it yet. For example, we might currently believe it’s impossible to travel faster than the speed of light, but future discoveries could change that perspective.

<!-- Speculative Nature of Possible Worlds -->
<div class="change-determinism">
  <h2 class="possibility-phil-header">
    Speculative Nature of Possible Worlds
  </h2>

  <p class="possibility-phil-text">
    The idea of possible worlds (different ways things could have been) is very speculative and abstract. Philosophers often talk about possible worlds to explain possibility and necessity. A possible world might be one where dinosaurs never went extinct and evolved to become the dominant intelligent species. Relying on these abstract concepts can make discussions about possibility and necessity seem disconnected from reality and harder to prove or disprove. For instance, while it’s an interesting idea to consider a world where dinosaurs rule, it’s purely speculative and doesn’t directly impact our understanding of the actual world we live in.
