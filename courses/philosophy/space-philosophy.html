    <h2 class="space-phil-header">What are space, time and change in metaphysics?</h2>
    <p class="space-phil-text">
       <b>Space</b> is the concept of the three-dimensional expanse in which objects and events occur and have relative position and direction. It refers to the area in which physical objects exist and move. Imagine an empty room. The room itself represents space, and when you place a chair in the room, the space is where the chair is positioned and can be moved around.
      <br> <br>
       <b>Time</b> is the continuous progression of existence and events from the past, through the present, and into the future. It is the dimension in which changes occur in the universe. Think of a clock ticking. The movement of the clock's hands from one second to the next represents the passage of time.<br> <br>
       <b>Change</b> refers to the process through which something becomes different over time. It involves any alteration in the state or properties of an object or system. Consider a caterpillar turning into a butterfly. This transformation is a change that occurs over time, demonstrating how an entity can alter its form or properties.

      <!-- Why do space, time and change  matter? -->
<div class="neccesities-container">
  <h2 class="space-phil-header">
    Why are space and neccesity essential?
  </h2>

  <p class="space-phil-text">
    <b> Understanding Physical Reality:</b>  Space, time, and change form the foundational fabric of our physical reality. Understanding these concepts helps us comprehend how the universe works on both large and small scales. Learning about Einstein's theory of relativity explains how space and time are interconnected and can be warped by gravity. This knowledge is essential for understanding phenomena like black holes, which bend space-time to an extreme degree.
    <br> <br>

    <b>Advancing Scientific Knowledge:</b> Progress in science and technology often hinges on a deep understanding of space, time, and change. Many scientific theories and discoveries are built upon these fundamental concepts. In real life, GPS satellites must account for time dilation effects due to their high speed and altitude relative to Earth, ensuring accurate global positioning.
    <br> <br>

    <b>Philosophical and Existential Insights:</b> Exploring space, time, and change encourages philosophical inquiry into the nature of reality, existence, and our place in the universe. Philosophical discussions about the nature of time can lead to insights about free will and determinism. Understanding different philosophical perspectives on change helps us grapple with the nature of identity and personal growth over time.
    <br> <br>
    <b>Essential Truths:</b> Necessity deals with truths that are always true, no matter what. Understanding necessary truths helps you grasp the foundations of logic, mathematics, and science, where certain principles must hold in all cases.

    Theories of Space, Time and Change
  </h2>

  <!-- Substantivalism -->
  <div class="substantivalism-container">
    <h2 class="space-phil-header">
      Substantivalism
    </h2>
<p class="space-phil-text">
  Substantivalism posits that space and time are independent entities that exist on their own, regardless of the objects or events within them. They are considered substances or entities in their own right. Imagine space as a container that exists independently of any objects inside it. Time flows uniformly and continuously, independent of any events happening within it.
<br>

</p>

  </div>

  <!-- Relationism -->
<div class="relationism-container">
  <h2 class="space-phil-header">
    Relationism
  </h2>
  <p class="space-phil-text">
    Relationism suggests that space and time only exist as relationships between objects or events. They do not have an independent existence apart from the objects that occupy them or the events that occur in them. According to relationism, space is defined by the distances between objects, and time is measured by the intervals between events. Without objects or events, there would be no space or time.

</div>

<!-- Presentism -->
<div class="presentism-container">
  <h2 class="space-phil-header">
    Presentism
  </h2>

  <p class="space-phil-text">
    Presentism asserts that only the present moment exists. Past and future moments are not real; they are just concepts or mental constructs. In presentism, the only reality is the current moment you are experiencing right now. The past, like yesterday or last year, is gone and no longer exists. The future, such as tomorrow or next year, hasn't happened yet and doesn't exist either.


  </p>
</div>

<!-- Eternalism -->
<div class="eternalism-container">
<h2 class="space-phil-header">
 Eternalism
</h2>
<p class="space-phil-text">
  Eternalism holds that past, present, and future moments all exist equally and simultaneously. Time is like a block or continuum where all moments are equally real. Imagine time as a long road where you can see all points from start to finish at once. Every moment, from your birth to your death, exists simultaneously in this block of time.

  Historically Notable Works on Space, Time and Change
  </h2>
  <div class="historical-container">
  <ol class="source-knowledge">
    <li class="space-list">
      <b>- Isaac Newton's "Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica" (1687):</b> Newton's work introduced his laws of motion and universal gravitation. It provided a mathematical framework (calculus) to describe how objects move through space and interact with each other under the influence of gravitational forces. This laid the foundation for classical mechanics and our understanding of how space, time, and change interact in physical systems.
    </li>

    <li class="space-list">
      <b>- Immanuel Kant's "Critique of Pure Reason" (1781): </b> Kant explored the nature of space and time as forms of intuition that structure our experience of the world. He argued that space and time are not objective entities existing independently of our perception but are frameworks through which we perceive and organize our sensory experiences. This philosophical perspective deeply influenced subsequent debates on the metaphysics of space and time.
    </li>

    <li class="space-list">
      <b>
        Albert Einstein's "The Meaning of Relativity" (1922):</b>
        Einstein's theory of relativity revolutionized our understanding of space, time, and gravity. Special relativity (1905) showed that space and time are interconnected aspects of a single entity called spacetime, where measurements of time and distance vary depending on the relative motion between observers. General relativity (1915) expanded this to include gravity as a curvature of spacetime, explaining how massive objects deform the fabric of spacetime itself.
    </li>

    <li class="space-list">
      <b>- Henri Bergson's "Creative Evolution" (1907):</b> Bergson proposed a philosophy of time as a continuous flow or duration rather than a series of discrete moments. He argued that our perception of time as linear and static does not capture its true essence, which is a dynamic process of continuous change and creation. His ideas influenced modern debates on the nature of time and its relation to human consciousness and evolution.
    </li>

    <li class="space-list">
      <b>- Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz's "Monadology" (1714):</b> Leibniz developed a theory of space and time as relational and constructed from the perspectives of individual monads (basic units of reality). He proposed that space is the order of coexisting things, and time is the order of successive things, both of which emerge from the fundamental nature of monads. His metaphysical ideas contributed to the ongoing discussion on the nature of space, time, and their role in the universe.

  <h2 class="space-phil-header">
    The Problem of Infinity
  </h2>
<p class="space-phil-text">
  Space and time seem to extend infinitely in all directions, raising questions about how to conceptualize something that has no end or beginning. Infinite space and time challenge our understanding because they are difficult to grasp or visualize. For instance, if the universe is infinite, how do we measure or comprehend its entirety?
</p>
</div>

<!-- Nature of Time -->
<div class="bundle-neccesities">
<h2 class="space-phil-header">
  The Nature of Time
</h2>
<p class="space-phil-text">
  Time appears to flow in a single direction from past to present to future, but the underlying nature of this flow remains a mystery. Understanding the fundamental nature of time—whether it is an objective feature of the universe or a subjective experience—poses challenges. For example, if time is subjective, does it exist independently of human perception?

</div>

<!-- Change and Persistence -->
<div class="change-determinism">
  <h2 class="space-phil-header">
    Change and Persistence
  </h2>

  <p class="space-phil-text">
    Objects and events change over time, yet they also persist in some form. Understanding how change occurs while entities maintain their identities is a key challenge. Explaining the nature of change and persistence raises philosophical questions. For instance, if an object changes (like a tree growing taller), when does it cease to be the same object? This dilemma is known as the problem of identity over time.
