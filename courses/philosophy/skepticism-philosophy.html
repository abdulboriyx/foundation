    <h2 class="skepticism-phil-header">What is skepticism?</h2>
    <p class="skepticism-phil-text">
      Skepticism in epistemology is the philosophical position that questions the possibility of certain knowledge. It challenges the certainty and reliability of knowledge claims, asserting that absolute knowledge or justified belief is either unattainable or significantly limited. Skepticism examines the grounds and methods by which beliefs are justified, highlighting the limitations of human cognition, perception, and reasoning in achieving absolute certainty about the world.
</p>

    <p class="skepticism-phil-text">
      Consider the debate over climate change. While the overwhelming majority of climate scientists agree that human activities contribute significantly to global warming, skeptics challenge this consensus. They argue that climate models may be flawed, data could be misinterpreted, or that the scientific community may be influenced by political agendas. Climate change skeptics often highlight instances where predictions haven't aligned with observed data or emphasize uncertainties in climate science.

    Why does skepticism matter?
  </h2>
  <p class="skepticism-phil-text">
   Skepticism matters for the following reasons:

    <ol class="source-skepticism">
      <!-- Critical Investigation -->
      <li class="skepticism-list">
        <b>- Advocates for Critical Investigation of Propositions:</b>
        The skeptical attitude is the reason why philosophers engage in profound examination of fundamentals, boundaries, and limits of knowledge. Through contesting our comprehension of things and our means of acquiring it, skepticism pinpoints and clarifies the criteria for justified beliefs and knowledge. This process helps to separate true knowledge from a mere opinion or belief.

        </li>


        <!-- Dogmatism -->
        <li class="skepticism-list">
        <b>- Assumptions, dogmatism preventions:</b> Skepticism also uncovers deeply rooted assumptions that are taken for granted. It is through this criticality that ideas are not entertained without enough evidences but rather an open mindedness to question everything. In contrast, skepticism maintains a dynamic perspective on philosophy which is never frozen into position.
        </li>

        <!-- Humilitiy -->
        <li class="skepticism-list">
          <b>- Promotes Humility in Intellectual endeavours:</b> Recognition of uncertainty involved in obtaining certain information makes skepticism build intellectual humility. Knowing one’s limitations and fallibilities lead to more careful consideration about matters concerning epistemology. This kind of meekness can result in stronger and well thought out theories on what constitutes knowledge.

   Academic Skepticism
  </h2>
<p class="skepticism-phil-text">
  Academic skepticism is a philosophical orientation that questions the possibility of having knowledge with certainty. It began in ancient Greece with figures like Pyrrho of Elis and was later endorsed by philosophers such as Sextus Empiricus. It suggests that there can be no complete certainty in knowledge because of human perceptive limitations, intellectual prowess and diversity of opinions and beliefs. Academic skepticism confronts the belief that we can have knowledge without any doubt or opposition. Instead of making positive or negative assertions about beliefs, academic skepticism holds for suspension of judgment (epoché) so that genuine knowledge may be based on defensible evidence or proof against skeptical questioning.

</p>
<p class="skepticism-phil-text">
  Consider a team of students investigating an ancient historical figure such as King Arthur. Each student discovers different stories and legends about King Arthur from books and websites. Some tales assert he was a great warrior who drew out a sword from a rock while others believe he had magical powers. For this reason, the students get doubtful since they read various versions of events without credible historical proofs behind them. They thus decide not to trust any one account they happen to come across but to query each story instead. To do this, they may need to go through more authoritative sources including history texts or items

<!-- Cartesian skepticism -->
<div class="cartesian-skepticism-container">
  <h2 class="skepticism-phil-header">Cartersian Skepticism
  </h2>
  <p class="skepticism-phil-text">
    Cartesian doubt is a philosophical position named after René Descartes, a 17th-century philosopher. To challenge the certainty of knowledge, Descartes introduced a method of doubting. He suggested that we should question everything which can possibly be doubted in order to discover what can be known without any doubt. Cartesian skepticism is the notion that one should query the falsehood about all their beliefs above all; their senses and external world with a view to find out what can really be known with absolute certainty.
  </p>

  <p class="skepticism-phil-text">
    Imagine waking up from an incredibly vivid dream where you were flying. In your dream, everything seemed so real: your feeling of flying, people you met and places you visited. But then you wake up and realize it was just a dream and none of it happened. Such experience makes you start asking yourself whether your senses are reliable or not. If in your dream your sensations can deceive you why are sure that they do not deceive you even now when wakeful? In this example, Cartesian skepticism might make you wonder if your experiences while awake are as dependable as they appear at first glance. It pushes for deep thought on whether one’s perception through the senses can be trusted with an aim of knowing absolutely anything about the surrounding environment.

<!-- Humean skepticism -->
<div class="humean-skepticism-container">
<h2 class="skepticism-phil-header">Humean Skepticism</h2>
<p class="skepticism-phil-text">
  The term stemming from Hume’s work is Humean skepticism which is a view that opposes the possibility of obtaining knowledge, especially when it comes to causation which is based on experience. Thus, Humean skepticism is the line of thought proclaiming that all our beliefs about the world, especially the ones concerning causation and induction, cannot be rationally justified. This indicates that: we can never be very sure of future events happening because past experiences have happened in the same way (problem of induction) and; we can never be very sure of one event causing another (problem of causation).


</p>

<p class="skepticism-phil-text">
  Suppose you notice that your neighbor’s car alarm blinks each morning at the same time with the garbage truck’s movement. Gradually, a kind of conditioning occurs, and you develop the thought process that the noise of the garbage truck causes the car alarm to sound. So, this example belongs to the type of causal reasoning: you see one event followed by another (garbage truck passing by and car alarm starting to sound) and you think that they are linked. Nevertheless, such feelings do not allow a follower of Humean skepticism to be sure that a garbage truck is ringing the car alarm. You have just demonstrated a relationship between the two scenarios, not a causality. The interruption such as a garbage truck passing by the neighborhood may just be a mere coincidence with the malfunctioning of the car alarm system or there could be other outstanding factors that are perhaps unknown to you. <br> <br>

<!-- Pyrrhonian skepticism -->
<div class="pyrrhonian-skepticism-container">
  <h2 class="skepticism-phil-header">Pyrrhonian skepticism</h2>
<p class="skepticism-phil-text">
  Pyrrhonian scepticism is the sceptical stance which is traced back to the ancient Greek philosopher Pyrrho of Elis. It recommends that we do not believe anything because there is no warrant to support any beliefs that we hold. Skepticism puts into questions whether human beings have certain knowledge in this world. It asserts that the reliable senses are not available, reasoning is weak, and perception depends on one’s view. Hence, it is recommended that we should not affirm or deny any belief to be true, because they could all be false.


</p>

<p class="skepticism-phil-text">
  Suppose one day you went to a museum with your friend; and your friend pointed at one of the painting saying, ‘This is masterpiece. ’ It is possible that you might agree with their judgment due to the extent of their enthusiasm or the status of the painting. Still, following the general tenets of Pyrrhonian skepticism, one would not go as far as to accept the actual dogmatism and say that this painting is a masterpiece. You accept that your friend has a right to have such opinion about the painting but at the same time do not allow yourself to make the definite conclusion which reads the painting deserves to be considered an art worth being exhibited, until you take the time to analyze the painting on your own. In this example, Pyrrhonian skepticism recommends a careful attitude to the formation of the opinions. It tells us that, there are aspects that we cannot go very far away from bias and the reality could be unique to one person and not to another. Hence, Pyrrhonian skeptics’ goal is to suspend judgment and avoid dogmatism in reasoning and opinion about the world.

    Arguments against skepticism
  </h2>

  <!-- Self-refuting Argument -->
  <div class="certainty-skepticism">
  <h2 class="skepticism-phil-header">
    The Self-Refutation Argument:
  </h2>
<p class="skepticism-phil-text">
  The skeptics opponents claimed that skepticism though being logically positive was self-refuting. To that, those skeptics who say that we cannot know anything must be told that their own claim falls under the things they claim not to be able to know. This paradox means that the statement saying that there is no knowledge, denies it at the same time since it is based on knowledge to say so.

<!-- The Practical Necessity Argument:  -->
<div class="practical-untenable-skepticism">
<h2 class="skepticism-phil-header">
  The Practical Necessity Argument:
</h2>
<p class="skepticism-phil-text">
  The opponents also argue that skepticism cannot work and does not fit the real world. This would be true, but every person, even a skeptic, must presuppose something in order to exist and perform the tasks of everyday life. For instance, they rely on feeling to shun risks or to converse with other individuals. This argument suggests that if the skeptical approach is put into use who will act or rather who will move a muscle, this is due to the fact that skeptics see all actions as futile.

  <h2 class="skepticism-phil-header">
    The Reliability of Cognitive Faculties
  </h2>
  <p class="skepticism-phil-text">
    Yet, another reason given in support of anti-skepticism is based on the postulate of the general trustworthiness of our cognitive processes. This view, which is tied to various degrees of epistemological reliabilism, is the notion that our senses, and thought processes are for the most part reliable in giving us the truth about reality. Although mistakes are sometimes made, the general ability of human beings to get around and make sense of the world around them in effect bolsters the reliability of the mental assets that people possess to allow for the acquisition of useful and true knowledge.
