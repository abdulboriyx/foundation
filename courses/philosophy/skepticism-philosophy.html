    <h2 class="skepticism-phil-header">What is skepticism?</h2>
    <p class="skepticism-phil-text">
      Skepticism in epistemology is the philosophical position that questions the possibility of certain knowledge. It challenges the certainty and reliability of knowledge claims, asserting that absolute knowledge or justified belief is either unattainable or significantly limited. Skepticism examines the grounds and methods by which beliefs are justified, highlighting the limitations of human cognition, perception, and reasoning in achieving absolute certainty about the world.
</p>

    <p class="skepticism-phil-text">
      Consider the debate over climate change. While the overwhelming majority of climate scientists agree that human activities contribute significantly to global warming, skeptics challenge this consensus. They argue that climate models may be flawed, data could be misinterpreted, or that the scientific community may be influenced by political agendas. Climate change skeptics often highlight instances where predictions haven't aligned with observed data or emphasize uncertainties in climate science.

  <p class="skepticism-phil-text">
   Skepticism matters for the following reasons:

    <ol class="source-skepticism">
      <!-- Critical Examination of Knowledge Claims -->
      <li class="skepticism-list">
        <b>- Critical Examination of Knowledge Claims:</b>
        Skepticism encourages a rigorous examination of knowledge claims by questioning the grounds on which beliefs are justified. It challenges assumptions and biases that can lead to unwarranted certainty, promoting a more careful and reflective approach to understanding what can be known.

        </li>


        <!-- Limits of Human Understanding -->
        <li class="skepticism-list">
        <b>- Limits of Human Understanding:</b> By highlighting the limits of human cognition, perception, and reasoning, skepticism reminds us of the fallibility inherent in our quest for knowledge. It underscores that our beliefs may be subject to error or revision in light of new evidence or perspectives.
        </li>

        <!-- Defence Against Dogmatism -->
        <li class="skepticism-list">
          <b>- Defense Against Dogmatism:</b> Skepticism acts as a defense against dogmatism by promoting intellectual openness and skepticism toward overly confident assertions. It encourages intellectual honesty and critical thinking, fostering a healthier intellectual environment where beliefs are continually scrutinized and refined.

   Academic Skepticism
  </h2>
<p class="skepticism-phil-text">
  Academic skepticism refers to a philosophical position that questions the possibility of attaining knowledge with certainty. Originating in ancient Greece with figures like Pyrrho of Elis and later popularized by philosophers like Sextus Empiricus, academic skepticism asserts that absolute certainty in knowledge is unattainable due to the limitations of human perception, cognition, and the variability of opinions and beliefs. Academic skepticism challenges the notion that we can achieve knowledge that is beyond doubt or contradiction. It emphasizes suspension of judgment (epoché) rather than affirmation or denial of beliefs, arguing that genuine knowledge requires irrefutable evidence or justification that can withstand skeptical inquiry.
</p>
<p class="skepticism-phil-text">
  Imagine a group of students researching a historical figure from ancient times, like King Arthur. Each student finds different stories and legends about King Arthur in books and on the internet. Some stories claim he was a great warrior who pulled a sword from a stone, while others say he had magical powers.
  Because the students encounter conflicting stories and no solid historical evidence, they decide to be skeptical. Instead of just believing any single story they find, they decide to question each one carefully. They might look for more reliable sources, like historical documents or artifacts, to see if they can find clearer evidence. Until they find more reliable information, they remain skeptical about which stories about King Arthur are true.
  In this example, academic skepticism encourages the students to doubt the stories they come across until they have stronger evidence to support what they believe about King Arthur.

<!-- Cartesian skepticism -->
<div class="cartesian-skepticism-container">
  <h2 class="skepticism-phil-header">Cartersian Skepticism
  </h2>
  <p class="skepticism-phil-text">
    Cartesian skepticism refers to a philosophical position named after René Descartes, a 17th-century philosopher. Descartes introduced a method of doubt to challenge the certainty of knowledge. He proposed that we should doubt everything that can possibly be doubted in order to find what can be known with certainty. Cartesian skepticism is the idea that we should question the truth of everything we believe, especially our senses and the external world, in order to find what can truly be known with absolute certainty.
  </p>

  <p class="skepticism-phil-text">
    Imagine you wake up from a vivid dream where you were flying. In the dream, everything felt real—your sensation of flying, the people you saw, and the places you visited. Upon waking up, you realize it was just a dream, and none of it actually happened. This experience makes you question the reliability of your senses and perception. If your senses can deceive you in a dream, how can you be absolutely certain that they aren't deceiving you right now, in waking life? In this example, Cartesian skepticism would encourage you to doubt whether your waking experiences are as reliable as they seem. It challenges you to think deeply about whether you can trust what you perceive through your senses, ultimately aiming to discover what, if anything, you can truly know with certainty about the world around you.

<!-- Humean skepticism -->
<div class="humean-skepticism-container">
<h2 class="skepticism-phil-header">Humean Skepticism</h2>
<p class="skepticism-phil-text">
  Humean skepticism, named after the philosopher David Hume, is a philosophical stance that questions the possibility of certain knowledge, especially in areas where we rely on experience and causation. Humean skepticism argues that our beliefs about the world, particularly those based on causation and induction, cannot be justified by reason alone. It suggests that we cannot know for sure that events will happen in the future just because they have happened in the past (problem of induction), and we cannot prove that one event causes another with absolute certainty (problem of causation).
</p>

<p class="skepticism-phil-text">
Imagine you observe that every morning your neighbor's car alarm goes off just as the garbage truck passes by. Over time, you start to believe that the sound of the garbage truck somehow causes the car alarm to go off. This is an example of causal reasoning—you observe a regular succession of events (garbage truck passing, then car alarm sounding) and infer a causal relationship between them. However, according to Humean skepticism, you cannot be absolutely certain that the garbage truck is causing the car alarm to go off. You have only observed a correlation, not a necessary connection. The garbage truck passing could be coincidentally timed with a malfunction in the car alarm system, or there could be other factors at play that you're not aware of. <br> <br>
In this example, Humean skepticism challenges your belief in causation. It suggests that even though you observe a regular pattern, you cannot prove with certainty that the garbage truck causes the car alarm to sound. This skepticism encourages a critical examination of how we form beliefs about cause and effect based on our experiences.

      <b>Reliable Process:</b> Maria's belief that it will rain is justified because her method of predicting weather (observing specific atmospheric conditions) has proven to be reliable. This process typically leads to true beliefs about weather conditions in her region.
    </li>

    <li class="skepticism-list source-list">
      <b>Relevant Circumstance:</b> Maria's reliability in predicting rain depends on specific circumstances (darkening skies, temperature changes) that are relevant to her method. These circumstances contribute to the skepticism of her belief.
    </li>

    <li class="skepticism-list source-list">
      <b>Awareness of Process:</b> Maria's belief remains justified even if she doesn't explicitly think about the reliability of her method each time she predicts rain. The focus is on the consistency and effectiveness of her process rather than her conscious awareness of it.

<!-- Pyrrhonian skepticism -->
<div class="pyrrhonian-skepticism-container">
  <h2 class="skepticism-phil-header">Pyrrhonian skepticism</h2>
<p class="skepticism-phil-text">
  Pyrrhonian skepticism, named after the Greek philosopher Pyrrho of Elis, is a philosophical position that doubts the possibility of attaining true knowledge about anything. It suggests that we should suspend judgment on all beliefs because there is no sufficient evidence or reason to justify them. Pyrrhonian skepticism challenges the idea that we can have certain knowledge about the world. It argues that our senses are fallible, our reasoning is limited, and our perceptions are subjective. Therefore, we should adopt an attitude of skepticism and refrain from affirming or denying any belief as true.
</p>

<p class="skepticism-phil-text">
  Imagine you visit a museum with a friend who tells you that a painting is a masterpiece. You might initially accept their judgment based on their enthusiasm and the painting's reputation. However, from a Pyrrhonian skeptical perspective, you would suspend judgment about whether the painting is truly a masterpiece. You acknowledge that your friend's opinion is valid to them, but you refrain from forming a definite belief about the painting's artistic merit until you've examined it critically yourself. In this example, Pyrrhonian skepticism encourages a cautious approach to forming beliefs. It reminds us that our perceptions and judgments can be influenced by subjective factors, and what seems true or beautiful to one person may not be the same for another. Therefore, Pyrrhonian skeptics advocate for maintaining an open mind and refraining from asserting certainty in our beliefs about the world.

  <!-- Undermining Certainty -->
  <div class="certainty-skepticism">
  <h2 class="skepticism-phil-header">
    Undermining Certainty
  </h2>
<p class="skepticism-phil-text"> Skepticism challenges the possibility of achieving certainty in knowledge. It argues that no belief can be held with absolute certainty because our perceptions and reasoning are fallible. This skepticism undermines our confidence in what we claim to know, leading to a sense of epistemic humility where we are reluctant to assert absolute truths. <br> <br>
  Let's take an example involving a student preparing for an exam. The student has studied diligently, reviewed all the materials, and feels confident about their knowledge of the subject. They believe they are well-prepared and are likely to perform well on the exam. However, a skeptic might challenge this certainty by pointing out that there's always a possibility of unexpected questions or topics on the exam that the student hasn't encountered before. The skeptic might argue that the student's confidence is based on their current understanding, which could be incomplete or mistaken in some aspects. This skepticism undermines the student's certainty about their preparedness for the exam, making them realize that their knowledge might not cover every possible scenario.
<br> <br>
  In this way, skepticism about certainty highlights how our beliefs, even when well-supported and seemingly reliable, can still be subject to doubt and uncertainty. It encourages us to acknowledge the limitations of our knowledge and the potential for gaps or errors in our understanding.

<!-- Practical Untenable -->
<div class="practical-untenable-skepticism">

  Practical Untenable
</h2>
<p class="skepticism-phil-text">
  Complete skepticism is often criticized as being practically untenable in everyday life. Critics argue that consistently applying skeptical doubt to all beliefs would make normal functioning impossible. Even David Hume, a prominent skeptic, acknowledged that "the complete skeptic would wind up starving to death or walking into walls or out of windows. <br> <br>

  Imagine a person who adopts extreme skepticism in everything they encounter. For instance, when they wake up in the morning and see sunlight coming through the window, a skeptic might doubt whether it's really sunlight or just a trick of the light. They might question if the floor beneath their feet is solid or if it's an illusion. When they go to eat breakfast, they might doubt whether the food is real or if it's a hallucination. This extreme skepticism can lead to paralysis because they can't trust their senses or their reasoning about anything.
<br> <br>
In practical terms, this skepticism would make it incredibly challenging for someone to function normally. They might refuse to eat because they doubt the reality of food, or they might hesitate to walk because they doubt the solidity of the ground. They could even doubt their own existence or the existence of others around them, leading to a state of constant uncertainty and indecision.

<!-- Potentially Unnecessary -->

Potentially Unnecessary
  </h2>
  <p class="skepticism-phil-text">
     Some philosophers argue that skepticism raises false problems by ignoring how knowledge claims actually function in practice. Thinkers like A.J. Ayer and John Austin contended that if we define knowledge using meaningful criteria that reflect how claims are actually made and justified, many skeptical challenges become unnecessary. They argue that there are, in fact, practical criteria for distinguishing between illusory and veridical experiences. <br> <br>

     Imagine you're discussing with a friend the idea of whether your favorite restaurant serves good food. Your friend might express skepticism by saying, "How can you really know the food is good? Taste is subjective, and your senses could be deceiving you." In response, you might argue that while taste is subjective, there are practical ways to determine if the food is generally liked, such as reading reviews, talking to other customers, or considering the reputation of the restaurant.
    <br>
     Philosophers like A.J. Ayer and John Austin take a similar approach. They argue that skepticism sometimes creates unnecessary challenges by demanding absolute certainty or ignoring practical ways we assess knowledge. For example, when we evaluate a restaurant's food quality, we don't need to be absolutely certain in a skeptical sense. Instead, we rely on practical criteria like reviews, personal experiences, and consensus among others who have visited the restaurant. These practical criteria help us make reasonable judgments without needing to address extreme skeptical doubts about our senses or knowledge claims.
