    <h2 class="mind-phil-header">What is philosophy of mind?</h2>
    <p class="mind-phil-text">
      Philosophy of mind examines fundamental questions such as: What is consciousness? How do thoughts and perceptions arise? Are mental states reducible to physical states? It explores various theories and perspectives to address these questions, ranging from dualism (which posits a distinction between mind and body) to materialism (which views mental states as being entirely reducible to physical processes).
      <br> <br>
      Consider the concept of "qualia," which are the subjective experiences of individuals. Qualia refer to the raw, subjective feels of sensory experiences, like the taste of chocolate or the pain of a headache. While neuroscience can explain the physical processes that occur when we taste chocolate or experience pain, it struggles to account for the subjective experience itself—the qualia.

<div class="mind-container">
  <h2 class="mind-phil-header">
    Why is philosophy of mind essential?
  </h2>

  <p class="mind-phil-text">
    Philosophy of mind helps us grapple with questions about the nature of consciousness and its implications for AI. For example, debates over whether AI systems can truly be conscious like humans provoke discussions about what consciousness entails. Understanding these philosophical nuances is crucial for developing AI technologies that respect ethical boundaries and align with human values. For instance, philosophers and AI researchers debate whether an AI system can experience subjective qualia (like pain or pleasure) or possess genuine self-awareness.
    <br> <br>
    As neuroscience advances, so too do possibilities for cognitive enhancement through drugs or brain stimulation. Philosophy of mind plays a pivotal role in exploring ethical questions surrounding these technologies. For instance, should we enhance cognitive abilities to improve academic or professional performance? Philosophical inquiry helps us evaluate the potential consequences on personal identity, autonomy, and societal fairness, guiding responsible policy-making and public discourse.
    <br> <br>
    Discussions on free will, determinism, and moral responsibility are central in philosophy of mind. For example, philosophers explore whether our actions are determined by prior causes (determinism) or if we possess genuine agency (free will). These debates have profound implications for legal systems, ethics, and personal accountability. Understanding these philosophical perspectives informs how societies define justice, construct laws, and approach moral dilemmas.

<!-- The Mind-Body Problem -->
<div class="mind-body-container">
  <h2 class="mind-phil-header">
  The Mind-Body Problem
  </h2>
  <p class="mind-phil-text">
    The mind-body issue is an archetype of the philosophical concerns; they concentrate on the character of the mind and its connection to the body. It seeks to know how different modes of perceiving the world, thinking, feeling and being aware are connected to the physiological structures of the brain and other neural augmentations. Various theories attempt to address this problem: there is the concept of mind and body as two separate entities, physicalist theory holds the opinion that mental states can be explained in terms of physiological processes, while emergentist theory hold the opinion that mental properties arise from the physiological substrates.

<!-- Consciousness -->
<div class="consciousness-container">
  <h2 class="mind-phil-header">
    Consciousness
  </h2>
  <p class="mind-phil-text">
    Consciousness is an individual’s subjective experience of the internal and external environment by means of sensations, thoughts, moods, and perceptions. That is what gives the opportunity to interact with the surroundings and comprehend them in certain manner. It has long been described and analyzed by philosophers and scientists asking questions like: what is consciousness, what kind of phenomenon can it be, can it be reduced and explained in scientific terms, and does consciousness exist in other organisms and in artificially created entities. There are different theories that have been proposed to explain the occurrence of consciousness including the higher-order theories that view consciousness as resulting from one’s capacity to think about his/her mental states, integrated information theory that sees consciousness as supported by integration of information within neural networks.
  </p>

<!-- Mental states and intentionality -->
<div class="mental-states-container">
  <h2 class="mind-phil-header">
    Mental states and intentionality
  </h2>

  <p class="mind-phil-text">
    In the philosophy of mind, mental states are termed as the internal and psychological conditions that are possessed by a person, for instance; beliefs, desires, emotions, perceivings, thoughts etc. Such states are supposed to be subjective and only the subject of the thought can have direct access to these states. Epistemologists investigate how these mental states come into being, what type of things they are, and how they are connected to the physical reality, most notably the brain.  <br> <br>
    Whereas, intentionality which pertain to the fact that mental states are directed towards something or they are ‘about’ something this is sometimes termed as ‘aboutness. ’ Beliefs are about propositions, desires are about things which are wanted and perceptions are about things in the world. Intentionality is crucial for learning how various mental states are anchored in the world,and how they are linked to action and thought.
  </p>
</div>

<!-- Philosophy of Perception -->
<div class="perception-container">
  <h2 class="mind-phil-header">
   Philosophy of Perception
  </h2>
  <p class="mind-phil-text">
    The epistemology of perception deals with how people see things and the meaning that they attach to them. It gives rise to issues concerning perception, the connection between experience and reality, and the mind’s contribution into comprehending the physical world. Direct realism is when the perception one has is of the true reality while representationalism is when the perception one has is an intermediate thing that stands between the reality and the person’s mind. According to the Sense-data theory, the perception involves the formation of intermediary mental objects or qualities or sense data that stand for attributes of objects out there.

    AI and Machine Consciousness
  </h2>

  <p class="mind-phil-text">
    AI and machine consciousness or a branch that explores the philosophy and scientific aspects of cognitive science and computers. AI is a branch of computer science that involves the computation able to perform tasks, which have until now relied on the human intelligence, like learning and decision making. Machine consciousness on the other hand focuses on the aspects of making machines have what is similar to human subjective awareness. Such issues stir deep scientific issues on the existence of consciousness, on the morality of developing conscious machines, and their capability to show personality like being self-conscious and having feelings. Tertulias filosóficas habitualan cuestionar si la conciencia existe como producto del cauce computacional o si existen restricciones a cualquier otra forma no biológica de conciencia.

<!--  Embodied cognition -->
<div class="cognition-container">
  <h2 class="mind-phil-header">
    Embodied Cognition
  </h2>
  <p class="mind-phil-text">
    Ecological approach/Embodied cognition is one of the theory in cognitive science and philosophy that concern the role of body and its relation with the environment to influence thought and awareness. In opposition to the conventional thought which underlines the determining role of cognition by the brain functions, the EBC is based on the postulates that all the psychological phenomena are influenced by the bodily experiences and sensory-motor actions together with the context in which an organism is located. This view assumes that cognition is not only a result of activity within the neural net, but also a process arising out of an organism’s integration of bodily perception, as well as perception of environment, and of the action environment or affordances. Embodied cognition changes the conception of cognition being a process that is internal and separate from the body; showing how bodily experiences and interactions with the environment are all grounded of cognition.

  Historically Notable Works on Philosophy of Mind
  </h2>
  <div class="historical-container">
  <ol class="source-knowledge">
    <li class="mind-list">
      <b>- "Meditations on First Philosophy" by René Descartes (1641)</b>: Descartes' work is pivotal for its introduction of Cartesian dualism, which posits that the mind (res cogitans) and body (res extensa) are distinct substances. His famous statement "Cogito, ergo sum" ("I think, therefore I am") highlights the foundational role of consciousness in human existence and philosophical inquiry.
    </li>

    <li class="mind-list">
      <b>- ""The Principles of Psychology" by William James (1890): </b> William James is considered one of the founders of modern psychology and his work heavily influenced the development of functionalism. In this book, James explores the nature of consciousness, the stream of thought, and the relationship between the mind and body. His ideas laid the groundwork for later theories in psychology and philosophy of mind.


    </li>

    <li class="mind-list">
      <b>-"The Concept of Mind" by Gilbert Ryle (1949): </b> Ryle's work is influential for its critique of Cartesian dualism and its development of the theory of behaviorism. Ryle argued against the "ghost in the machine" view of the mind and proposed that mental states are best understood as dispositions to behave in certain ways. This helped shift the focus in philosophy of mind towards examining observable behaviors rather than postulating inner mental states.


    </li>

    <li class="mind-list">
      <b>- "Consciousness Explained" by Daniel Dennett (1991):</b>  Dennett's book is notable for its comprehensive exploration of consciousness from a materialist and functionalist perspective. He challenges traditional views of consciousness and proposes a theory of consciousness as a series of cognitive processes and mental representations. Dennett's work continues to influence contemporary debates on consciousness, artificial intelligence, and the nature of mind.

  <!--  The Hard Problem of Consciousness -->
  <div class="hard-problem-mind">
  <h2 class="mind-phil-header">
    The Hard Problem of Consciousness:
  </h2>
<p class="mind-phil-text">
  Perhaps the most daunting challenge in philosophy of mind is the "hard problem of consciousness," famously articulated by philosopher David Chalmers. This problem asks why and how subjective experiences—qualia such as the redness of red or the taste of chocolate—arise from physical processes in the brain. Unlike "easy" problems of consciousness, which concern the cognitive functions and behaviors associated with consciousness, the hard problem seeks to explain the very nature of conscious experience itself. This challenge raises profound metaphysical and epistemological questions about whether consciousness can be fully understood through scientific inquiry or if it represents a fundamentally different kind of phenomenon beyond current scientific frameworks.

<!-- Mind-body Problem -->

<h2 class="mind-phil-header">Mind-body Problem</h2>
<p class="mind-phil-text">
  The mind-body problem remains a central concern in philosophy of mind. This problem explores how mental states—such as thoughts, beliefs, and emotions—are related to physical processes in the brain and body. Different philosophical perspectives propose various solutions: dualism posits a separation between mental and physical substances, physicalism argues that mental states are reducible to physical states or processes, and emergentism suggests that mental properties emerge from complex physical systems. Resolving the mind-body problem is crucial for understanding human identity, the nature of consciousness, and how mental phenomena interact with the physical world.

    Ethical & Practical Implications of AI
  </h2>

  <p class="mind-phil-text">
    With rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), questions about machine consciousness and ethical considerations have become increasingly pressing. If AI systems can exhibit behaviors and cognitive abilities comparable to human intelligence, should they be considered conscious beings? The implications of creating conscious machines raise ethical concerns about autonomy, moral agency, and the rights of artificial entities. Furthermore, the development of AI challenges traditional conceptions of what it means to be human and the ethical responsibilities associated with creating intelligent systems. Philosophers of mind grapple with these issues as AI technologies continue to evolve, shaping future debates on consciousness, ethics, and the intersection of humanity and technology.
