      What is Ancient Civilization? 
    </h1>
    <p class="topic-cover-text">
      An ancient civilization refers to a complex and organized society that existed in the distant past, characterized by the development of cities, agriculture, government systems, social hierarchies, religion, trade, and often writing systems. These civilizations emerged independently in various parts of the world, usually near rivers or fertile regions, where they developed advanced cultures, innovations, and technologies that laid the foundation for modern society. <br> <br>

      Mesopotamia, known as the "land between rivers," was one of the earliest and most influential ancient civilizations, flourishing around 3500 BCE. It consisted of various city-states such as Sumer, Akkad, Babylon, and Assyria, each contributing to advancements in technology, literature, law, and architecture. <br> <br>

      In Mesopotamia, agriculture thrived due to the irrigation systems that channeled water from the Tigris and Euphrates rivers to the fields. This resulted in surplus food production, which supported population growth and the rise of cities. Mesopotamians developed one of the earliest known writing systems, cuneiform, which was used for record-keeping, administration, and literature, including the famous Epic of Gilgamesh, one of the world’s oldest surviving works of literature. <br> <br>

      Additionally, Mesopotamians are credited with the creation of the first known code of laws, the Code of Hammurabi (circa 1754 BCE), which laid out a legal framework that governed social relations, business practices, and criminal punishment. The legacy of Mesopotamian law, mathematics, and astronomy still influences modern cultures today.
