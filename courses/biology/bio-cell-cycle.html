      What is Cell Cycle ?
    </h1>
    <p class="topic-cover-text">
      The cell cycle is the series of events that cells go 
      through as they grow, replicate their DNA, and divide 
      to form two daughter cells. It is a fundamental process 
      that enables organisms to grow, develop, and maintain 
      their tissues. The cell cycle consists of several distinct 
      phases, each of which plays a specific role in the life of a cell.

      Why is it essential to learn Cell Theory?
    </h1>
    <p class="topic-cover-text">
      The cell cycle is the process by which cells grow, replicate their DNA, and divide into two new cells. This cycle is crucial for growth, repair, and maintenance in all living organisms. For example, when you get a cut on your skin, cells at the wound site go through the cell cycle to produce new cells that replace the damaged ones. Understanding the cell cycle helps us comprehend how normal cellular functions occur and how tissues and organs grow and repair themselves. Without proper cell cycle regulation, cells can’t divide correctly, which impacts everything from healing wounds to overall development.
      <br> <br>

      Cancer is often caused by disruptions in the cell cycle, leading to uncontrolled cell division. Normally, the cell cycle has checkpoints that ensure cells only divide when necessary and that any damage is repaired before proceeding. In cancer, these checkpoints can be bypassed or malfunction, resulting in the rapid growth of abnormal cells. For instance, in breast cancer, mutations in genes that regulate the cell cycle, such as BRCA1 or BRCA2, can lead to uncontrolled cell proliferation. By studying the cell cycle, scientists and doctors can better understand the mechanisms behind cancer and develop targeted therapies to correct these disruptions. <br> <br>

      Many drugs and treatments work by targeting specific stages of the cell cycle. For example, chemotherapy drugs used to treat cancer often target rapidly dividing cells, which are characteristic of tumors. Understanding the cell cycle allows researchers to develop drugs that specifically disrupt the cycle at certain points to inhibit cancer cell proliferation while minimizing damage to normal cells. Additionally, understanding how cells repair DNA damage during the cycle can lead to better treatments for diseases caused by genetic mutations or environmental damage, such as certain genetic disorders or age-related diseases.

    <h1 class="topic-header">
      Interphase
    </h1>
    <p class="topic-cover-text">
      Interphase is the phase where the cell spends most of its life, preparing for division. It is divided into three sub-stages: G1, S, and G2.
    </p>

    <!-- G1 Phase (Growth) -->
     <h2 class="topic-header">
      G1 Phase (Growth 1)
     </h2>
     <p class="topic-cover-text">
      In this stage, the cell grows in size and carries out its normal functions. It also synthesizes proteins and organelles needed for cell division. For example, a skin cell in the G1 phase is producing proteins and organelles that help it function and prepare for future division.
     </p>

     <!-- S Phase (Synthesis) -->
      <h2 class="topic-header">
      S Phase (Synthesis)
      </h2>
      <p class="topic-cover-text">
      During the S phase, the cell replicates its DNA, ensuring that each new cell will have an identical set of chromosomes. For example, a liver cell duplicates its genetic material during the S phase so that after division, both new liver cells have the same genetic information.
      </p>

      <!-- G2 Phase (Growth 2) -->
      <h2 class="topic-header">
            G2 Phase (Growth 2)
      </h2>
      <p class="topic-cover-text">
       The cell continues to grow and prepare for division by synthesizing more proteins and organelles. It also checks the duplicated DNA for any errors. For instance, a muscle cell in the G2 phase ensures that everything is ready and correct before proceeding to the actual division process.

        Mitosis
      </h1>
      <p class="topic-cover-text">
      Mitosis is the process of dividing the cell’s nucleus and its contents to ensure that each daughter cell receives an identical set of chromosomes.
      </p>

      <!-- Prophase -->
       <h2 class="topic-header">
        Prophase
       </h2>
       <p class="topic-cover-text">
      The chromatin (DNA and proteins) condenses into visible chromosomes. The nuclear envelope breaks down, and spindle fibers begin to form. For example, in a human cell, the chromosomes condense into X-shaped structures that are visible under a microscope.
       </p>

       <!-- Metaphase -->
        <h2 class="topic-header">
       Metaphase
        </h2>
        <p class="topic-cover-text">
        Chromosomes align in the middle of the cell, known as the metaphase plate. Spindle fibers attach to the centromeres of the chromosomes. For instance, in a plant cell, the chromosomes line up neatly along the center, preparing for separation.
        </p>

        <!-- Anaphase -->
         <h2 class="topic-header">
            Anaphase
         </h2>
         <p class="topic-cover-text">
            The spindle fibers pull the sister chromatids apart toward opposite poles of the cell. This ensures that each new cell will receive an identical set of chromosomes. For example, in a nerve cell, the centromeres split, and the chromatids move to opposite sides of the cell.
         </p>

            Telophase
          </h2>
          <p class="topic-cover-text">
            The chromosomes reach the poles and begin to de-condense back into chromatin. The nuclear envelope reforms around each set of chromosomes, creating two nuclei within the cell. For example, in an animal cell, the two sets of chromosomes are now encased in new nuclear membranes.

       <h2 class="topic-header">
         Animal Cells
      </h2>
      <p class="topic-cover-text">
      Cytokinesis occurs through a process called cleavage furrow, where the cell membrane pinches inward until the cell is divided into two separate cells. For example, in a human cell, a cleavage furrow forms and deepens, eventually splitting the cell into two daughter cells, each with its own nucleus and organelles.
      </p>

       <h2 class="topic-header">
      Plant Cells
       </h2>
       <p class="topic-cover-text">
      Since plant cells have a rigid cell wall, cytokinesis occurs through the formation of a cell plate. Vesicles containing cell wall materials fuse to form the cell plate in the center of the cell, which gradually develops into a new cell wall, dividing the cell into two daughter cells. For example, in a plant root cell, the cell plate forms and expands until it fuses with the cell wall, completing the division process

      Discovery of the Cell Cycle Stages (1950s-1960s)
  </h2>
  <p class="topic-cover-text">
      The identification and characterization of the cell cycle stages were significantly advanced by researchers such as Ernest Everitt and James Watson. Their work elucidated the sequential phases of the cell cycle, including G1, S, G2, and M phases. This research was pivotal in establishing a framework for understanding how cells grow and divide, and laid the groundwork for future studies into the regulation of the cell cycle. <br> <br>

      The Discovery of Cyclins and Cyclin-dependent Kinases (CDKs) (1980s)
  </h2>
  <p class="topic-cover-text">
      In the 1980s, researchers such as Tim Hunt, Paul Nurse, and Leland Hartwell discovered cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). These proteins play a crucial role in regulating the cell cycle. Cyclins activate CDKs, which, in turn, drive the cell through different phases of the cycle. This discovery was fundamental in understanding the molecular mechanisms controlling cell division and has implications for cancer research.

      The Role of Checkpoints in the Cell Cycle (1990s)
  </h2>
  <p class="topic-cover-text">
      The discovery of cell cycle checkpoints, particularly the work of researchers like Brenda Andrews and David Beach, was instrumental in understanding how cells monitor and repair DNA damage before proceeding with division. Checkpoints ensure that cells only divide when they are ready and have no significant DNA damage, which is crucial for maintaining genomic stability and preventing cancer.

  <p class="topic-cover-text">
      The identification and characterization of the p53 tumor suppressor gene by researchers such as Arnold Levine and David Lane revealed its role in regulating the cell cycle and preventing the proliferation of cells with damaged DNA. p53 acts as a checkpoint protein that can halt the cell cycle in response to DNA damage, providing time for repair or triggering apoptosis if the damage is irreparable. This discovery has had a profound impact on our understanding of cancer biology and therapeutic strategies.

    <h1 class="topic-header">
      Facts about Cell Structure
    </h1>
    <p class="topic-cover-text">
      The Anaphase Promoting Complex (APC) is a critical regulator of the cell cycle, particularly during the transition from metaphase to anaphase in mitosis. APC functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, marking specific proteins for degradation. This process ensures that chromosomes are properly segregated into daughter cells by triggering the degradation of proteins that inhibit anaphase onset. Its role is crucial for accurate chromosome separation and preventing aneuploidy. <br> <br>

      While the cell cycle is often discussed in terms of G1, S, G2, and M phases, the G0 phase is a less frequently highlighted but essential aspect. Cells in G0 are in a quiescent state where they are not actively dividing. This phase allows cells to exit the cycle temporarily and can be a response to nutrient deprivation, DNA damage, or differentiation signals. The ability to enter and exit G0 is vital for tissue maintenance and response to environmental changes. <br> <br>

      Recent research has uncovered that circadian rhythms, the internal biological clock that regulates the sleep-wake cycle, also influence the cell cycle. Cells can synchronize their division cycles with the time of day, which helps optimize cell division and DNA repair processes. Disruptions to circadian rhythms have been linked to an increased risk of cancer and other health issues, highlighting the interplay between internal timing mechanisms and cell cycle regulation. <br> <br>

      While cell cycle checkpoints are well known for their role in responding to DNA damage, there are other checkpoints that regulate the cell cycle based on nutrient availability and cell size. For instance, the nutrient-sensing pathways and cell size checkpoints ensure that cells have adequate resources and reach a sufficient size before committing to division. These additional checkpoints integrate external and internal signals to regulate cell proliferation and ensure cellular homeostasis.<br> <br>

      The regulation of the cell cycle is not only crucial for cell division but also plays a key role in stem cell differentiation. Stem cells must carefully balance cell division with differentiation to produce specialized cell types while maintaining a stem cell population. The control of cell cycle progression is involved in deciding whether a stem cell will divide symmetrically to produce more stem cells or asymmetrically to generate differentiated progeny. This balance is critical for tissue development and regeneration.
