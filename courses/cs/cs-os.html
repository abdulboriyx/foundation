      What is Operating System? 
    </h1>
    <p class="topic-cover-text">
      An operating system (OS) is a fundamental software component that manages the hardware and software resources of a computer system, providing a stable and consistent way for applications to interact with the hardware. It acts as an intermediary between the user and the computer hardware, ensuring that different programs and users can operate the system effectively and without interference. The operating system controls the execution of applications, manages files, memory, and peripheral devices like printers and keyboards, and provides user interfaces such as command-line interfaces (CLI) or graphical user interfaces (GUI). Common examples of operating systems include Microsoft Windows, macOS, Linux, and Android, each tailored for specific types of devices like personal computers, servers, and mobile devices. At a deeper level, the OS handles critical tasks such as process management, where it allocates CPU time to various running programs; memory management, which involves tracking each byte in the system's memory and managing the allocation and deallocation of memory spaces; and file system management, where it oversees the creation, deletion, and access to files on storage devices. It also manages device drivers, which are specialized programs that allow the operating system to communicate with the hardware peripherals. Overall, the OS is the backbone of any computing environment, orchestrating the complex interplay between hardware and software, enabling users to interact with their computers in a seamless manner.<br> <br>

      Consider your smartphone, a device you use daily for communication, entertainment, work, and more. The operating system running on your smartphone, such as Android or iOS, is what makes it possible to use these features in a coordinated and efficient way. When you open an app, the operating system manages the phone's resources to ensure the app runs smoothly, without disrupting other functions like phone calls or notifications. For instance, if you are streaming music while browsing the web, the OS ensures that both tasks get enough processing power and memory to function correctly, even managing network resources to maintain your music stream while loading web pages.

      <p class="topic-cover-text">
            A Batch Operating System is one of the earliest types of operating systems, designed primarily for mainframe computers during the 1960s. In this type of OS, similar jobs are grouped together and executed sequentially as a "batch" without manual intervention. The jobs are collected, processed, and then the results are delivered. This system is ideal for tasks that require similar processing steps, like payroll processing, billing, or data analysis, where each task does not require direct interaction from the user. For example, in a payroll system, the batch OS will take in all employee data, process salaries, apply deductions, and produce pay slips in one go. The major advantage of batch systems is that they allow for efficient use of the computer's resources because jobs can be queued and executed without waiting for user input. However, they lack interactivity, meaning they are less suitable for real-time tasks. <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/batch-processing-operating-system/" class="info-link">More about Batch Operating System</a>

      Facts about Hardware and Software
    </h1>
    <p class="topic-cover-text">
      While many people are aware of basic security features like antivirus software, the kernel—the core component of an operating system—plays a crucial role in security at a much deeper level. The kernel operates with high privileges and controls hardware access, memory management, and process scheduling. Modern operating systems use advanced kernel-level security mechanisms such as Kernel Address Space Layout Randomization (KASLR) and Control Flow Integrity (CFI) to defend against exploits. KASLR randomizes the memory locations of kernel components to make it harder for attackers to predict where their malicious code might execute. CFI ensures that the control flow of programs remains predictable and within expected paths, preventing various types of attacks that manipulate execution paths. These features are integral to defending against sophisticated attacks and maintaining the integrity of the system.<br> <br>

      Not all file systems handle data corruption and crashes in the same way. Many modern operating systems use file systems with journaling capabilities to enhance data integrity. When a system crash or power failure occurs, a journaled file system records changes before they are actually written to the disk. This log allows the file system to recover to a consistent state by replaying or discarding incomplete operations. For instance, the ext4 file system on Linux and NTFS on Windows use journaling to prevent data loss and ensure that files and directories remain intact after unexpected shutdowns. This feature is crucial for maintaining the reliability and durability of data in everyday computing environments. <br> <br>

      The concept of virtual memory is fundamental to modern operating systems, yet it's not always well understood. Virtual memory allows an operating system to use disk storage as an extension of RAM, enabling it to handle more processes and larger applications than the physical memory alone would permit. This is achieved through a technique called paging, where the OS divides memory into fixed-size blocks called pages. When physical RAM is full, less frequently used pages are moved to a space on the disk known as the swap file or page file. This mechanism ensures that applications have the illusion of a large, contiguous block of memory, even if the actual physical memory is limited. Virtual memory is vital for multitasking and managing memory-intensive applications.<br> <br>

      Operating systems employ various process scheduling algorithms to manage how processes are executed by the CPU. While many users are familiar with the concept of multitasking, the algorithms used to decide which process runs at any given time are less commonly known. For example, Round-Robin Scheduling allocates time slices to each process in a circular order, ensuring fairness but not necessarily efficiency. Priority Scheduling assigns priorities to processes, allowing high-priority tasks to be executed first. More advanced algorithms, such as Multilevel Queue Scheduling and Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS) used in Linux, aim to balance between responsiveness and overall system throughput. Understanding these algorithms helps in appreciating how operating systems optimize performance and user experience.

      Operating systems operate in user mode and kernel mode, two distinct execution levels with different privileges. User mode is where user applications run, with restricted access to system resources to ensure stability and security. When an application needs to perform operations that require higher privileges—such as accessing hardware or interacting with system files—it must make a system call to switch to kernel mode. The kernel mode, which runs with full system privileges, handles these sensitive operations and then returns control to user mode. This separation is crucial for system stability and security, as it prevents user applications from directly interfering with the core functions of the operating system and the hardware. Understanding this distinction helps in grasping how operating systems maintain control and protect system integrity.
