  <!-- definition -->
    <div class="astro-topic planet-def">
    <p class="astro-text">
      Planets are large celestial bodies that orbit a star and do not produce their own light. They are significant components of a solar system and come in various sizes, compositions, and distances from their parent star. To be classified as a planet, a celestial body must meet three criteria set by the International Astronomical Union (IAU):
      <ol class="astro-list">
        <li class="astro-list-list astro-topic-text">
           The object must revolve around the Sun (or another star in different star systems).
        </li>

        <li class="astro-list-list astro-topic-text">
          It must have enough mass for its gravity to shape it into a nearly round form.
        </li>

        <li class="astro-list-list astro-topic-text">
          The object must have cleared its orbit of other debris.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <h1 class="astro-header">
      Types of Planets
    </h1>
    <p class="astro-text">
      Planets in our Solar System are categorized into two main types based on their physical characteristics: Terrestrial (Rocky) Planets and Gas Giants (Jovian Planets). Each type has distinct features that set them apart.
    </p>

    <h2 class="astro-header">
      Terrestrial Planets
    </h2>
    <p class="astro-text">
      Terrestrial planets are Earth-like planets with solid, rocky surfaces. They are closer to the Sun and have higher densities than gas giants. The four terrestrial planets in our Solar System are Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. These planets are characterized by their smaller size and greater density compared to gas giants. Their surfaces are composed of rock and metal, featuring mountains, craters, and volcanoes. The atmospheres of terrestrial planets are thinner compared to those of gas giants, with Earth having a rich atmosphere that supports life. Additionally, terrestrial planets have fewer moons; for example, Earth and Mars have natural satellites, while Mercury and Venus do not.
    </p>

    <h2 class="astro-header">
      Gas Giants
    </h2>

    <p class="astro-text">
      Gas giants are large planets composed mainly of hydrogen and helium. They lack a solid surface and are much larger than terrestrial planets. The four gas giants in our Solar System are Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, with the latter two sometimes referred to as "ice giants." These planets are significantly larger in size but have a lower density compared to terrestrial planets. Gas giants are composed mostly of hydrogen and helium, while ice giants have significant amounts of water, ammonia, and methane ices. They do not have well-defined solid surfaces and possess deep atmospheres with potentially small, rocky cores. Their thick atmospheres contain multiple layers of clouds and storms, with notable features such as Jupiter's Great Red Spot. Furthermore, gas giants have numerous moons and complex ring systems.
    </p>

    <h2 class="astro-header">
      What Makes Them Different to Separate Them into Types?
    </h2>

    <p class="astro-text">
      The primary factors that differentiate terrestrial planets from gas giants are their composition, location, and physical characteristics. Terrestrial planets are composed primarily of silicate rocks and metals, while gas giants are composed mainly of hydrogen and helium, with ice giants having additional compounds like water, ammonia, and methane. Terrestrial planets are located closer to the Sun, within the inner Solar System, whereas gas giants are located farther from the Sun, in the outer Solar System. <br> <br>

      Physically, terrestrial planets are smaller and denser, with solid, rocky surfaces. In contrast, gas giants are larger with lower density and lack a solid surface, possessing deep, thick atmospheres instead. The atmospheres of terrestrial planets are thinner (except for Earth), while gas giants have extensive atmospheres with complex weather systems. Terrestrial planets have fewer moons and no ring systems, whereas gas giants have numerous moons and prominent ring systems.

<!-- Formation of Sun -->
<div class="astro-topic planet-history">
<h1 class="astro-header">
  How does Planet form and change over time?
</h1>

<p class="astro-topic-text">
  The formation of planets begins in the vast, cold regions of space known as molecular clouds, which are composed of gas and dust. Within these clouds, a disturbance such as a nearby supernova explosion can cause regions to collapse under their own gravity, forming dense cores. As these cores contract, they heat up and begin to spin, eventually flattening into a rotating disk known as a protoplanetary disk. In the center of this disk, a protostar forms, which will eventually become a star. The remaining material in the disk, primarily gas and dust, begins to coalesce into clumps through a process called accretion, gradually forming planetesimals—small, solid objects that can attract more material due to their gravity. <br> <br>

  As planetesimals continue to collide and merge, they grow larger, forming protoplanets. These protoplanets undergo further collisions and accretion, leading to the formation of planets. The process can take millions of years, with the young planets experiencing intense bombardment by leftover planetesimals and debris, shaping their surfaces through impacts. The heat generated by these collisions, along with radioactive decay of elements within the planet, causes the interior to differentiate, forming a layered structure with a core, mantle, and crust. In the case of gas giants, they accumulate massive envelopes of hydrogen and helium, capturing gas from the surrounding disk before it dissipates. <br> <br>

  Once formed, planets continue to evolve over billions of years. Internal heat drives geological activity, such as volcanism and tectonics, which can reshape the surface. For terrestrial planets, the cooling of the interior leads to a decrease in volcanic activity over time, though some planets, like Earth, maintain active tectonics due to their size and internal heat. In contrast, smaller terrestrial bodies, like Mercury and the Moon, cool more rapidly and become geologically inactive. <br> <br>

  External factors also influence planetary evolution. The presence of an atmosphere, for instance, can lead to weathering and erosion of the surface. Planets close to their star can lose their atmospheres due to solar wind and radiation, while those farther away may retain thick atmospheres composed of gases like carbon dioxide, methane, or nitrogen. Additionally, impacts from comets and asteroids continue to shape planetary surfaces, creating craters and sometimes delivering essential compounds like water and organic molecules. <br> <br>

  Over time, the interactions between a planet's atmosphere, surface, and internal processes contribute to its unique characteristics. For example, Earth's climate and surface conditions have been heavily influenced by the presence of life, which has altered the atmosphere through processes like photosynthesis and respiration. In contrast, Mars, with its thin atmosphere and lack of significant geological activity, has a surface marked by ancient volcanoes and vast canyons, but no current evidence of life.

<!-- What makes planets habitable -->
<div class="topics-container">
<h1 class="main-content-header">
  What factors play a key role in a planet's habitability?
</h1>


<!-- Habitability -->
<div class="astro-topic planet-structure">
  <p class="astro-topic-text">
    The habitability of a planet, or its ability to support life, depends on a complex interplay of various factors, both intrinsic and extrinsic. Central to this is the presence of liquid water, which is essential for all known forms of life. The conditions required for liquid water to exist depend largely on the planet’s distance from its star, often referred to as the habitable zone or "Goldilocks zone." This zone is where temperatures are just right—neither too hot nor too cold—for liquid water to persist on the planet's surface. <br> <br>

    One of the primary intrinsic factors is the planet's atmosphere. A suitable atmosphere can regulate temperature through the greenhouse effect, which traps heat and maintains a stable climate. This atmosphere must be thick enough to protect the surface from harmful solar radiation and cosmic rays while providing essential gases like oxygen (for aerobic life) and carbon dioxide (for photosynthesis). Planets with a stable atmosphere are more likely to sustain surface water and support life. <br> <br>

    Another crucial factor is the planet's geologic activity. Active geology, driven by internal heat, contributes to a planet’s ability to recycle nutrients through processes like plate tectonics and volcanism. These processes can release gases from the planet’s interior, contributing to atmospheric composition and climate regulation. Additionally, plate tectonics play a key role in carbon cycling, which is vital for long-term climate stability. The presence of a magnetic field, generated by a molten, rotating iron core, is also important as it shields the planet from solar wind and cosmic radiation, which can strip away the atmosphere. <br> <br>

    Extrinsic factors, such as the characteristics of the host star, are equally significant. The star's stability and lifespan are critical; stable stars with long lifespans, like our Sun, provide a consistent energy source over billions of years, allowing life ample time to develop and evolve. Furthermore, the star’s spectral type influences the amount and type of radiation the planet receives. For example, planets orbiting M-type (red dwarf) stars might be within the habitable zone but could be subject to intense stellar flares, challenging the development of life. <br> <br>

    The planet's size and mass also affect its habitability. A planet needs to be large enough to maintain geological activity and a stable atmosphere but not so large that it becomes a gas giant. A sufficiently large mass ensures gravity can hold onto the atmosphere and support liquid water on the surface. Smaller planets, like Mars, struggle to retain their atmospheres and water due to their weaker gravitational pull. <br> <br>

    Lastly, the presence of essential chemical elements and compounds, such as carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and sulfur, is necessary for life as we know it. These elements must be available in the right proportions to support biochemical processes. Additionally, having a diverse environment with various habitats, such as oceans, rivers, and landmasses, can enhance the chances of life by providing different ecological niches.

      Mercury
    </h1>
    <p class="astro-topic-text">
      Mercury is the smallest planet in our Solar System and the closest one to the Sun. Understanding Mercury is essential for anyone studying the planets because it offers unique insights into planetary formation and the extreme conditions near our star. Let’s explore Mercury in detail, from its basic characteristics to its atmosphere, surface, and the missions that have studied it. <br> <br>
     </p>

      <!-- Basic Characteristics -->
      <h2 class="astro-header">
        Basic characteristics
      </h2>

      <p class="astro-topic-text">
        Mercury has a diameter of about 4,880 kilometers (3,032 miles), making it just slightly larger than Earth’s Moon. Despite its small size, it has a dense iron core that accounts for about 85% of its radius. This high density suggests that Mercury has a large metallic core relative to its size.

    <p class="astro-topic-text">
      Mercury orbits the Sun at an average distance of about 58 million kilometers (36 million miles). It takes approximately 88 Earth days to complete one orbit around the Sun. However, Mercury’s rotation is unique; it rotates on its axis once every 59 Earth days. This means that a single day on Mercury (sunrise to sunrise) lasts about 176 Earth days.
    </p>

    <!-- Surface and Temperature -->
    <h2 class="astro-header">
      Surface and Temperature
    </h2>
    <p class="astro-topic-text">
      Mercury’s surface is covered with craters, much like our Moon. These craters are the result of numerous impacts from asteroids and comets over billions of years. The planet has almost no atmosphere to erode these craters or to protect it from impacts.
    </p>

    <!-- temperature extremes -->
    <h2 class="astro-header">
      Temperature Extremes
    </h2>
    <p class="astro-topic-text">
      One of the most fascinating aspects of Mercury is its extreme temperature variations. Because it is so close to the Sun, daytime temperatures can soar up to 430 degrees Celsius (800 degrees Fahrenheit). However, without a significant atmosphere to retain heat, nighttime temperatures can plummet to -180 degrees Celsius (-290 degrees Fahrenheit). This drastic temperature change is one of the most extreme in the Solar System.

    <!-- Atmosphere -->
    <h2 class="astro-header">
      Atmosphere
    </h2>
    <p class="astro-topic-text">
      Mercury has a very thin atmosphere, also known as an exosphere. It is composed mostly of oxygen, sodium, hydrogen, helium, and potassium. The exosphere is so thin that it doesn’t provide any weather or climate as we experience on Earth. Instead, particles in the exosphere are constantly being lost to space and replenished by solar wind and micrometeoroid impacts.

    <p class="astro-topic-text">
      Despite its small size, Mercury has a magnetic field, although it is much weaker than Earth’s. This magnetic field is believed to be generated by its partially molten iron core. The presence of a magnetic field suggests that Mercury’s core is still active in some way, contributing to the planet’s geological dynamics.

  <p class="astro-topic-text">
    Mars has a very thin atmosphere, composed primarily of carbon dioxide (about 95%), with small amounts of nitrogen and argon. This thin atmosphere provides minimal insulation, contributing to the planet's cold temperatures. Mars' atmosphere also lacks the oxygen necessary to support human life and is prone to dust storms that can cover the entire planet.

      <strong>Jupiter has the largest storm in the Solar System</strong>. Known as the Great Red Spot, this massive storm has been raging for at least 400 years and is so large that it could fit three Earths side by side. The Great Red Spot is a high-pressure region producing intense winds and storms in Jupiter’s atmosphere.

      <strong>Saturn's rings are primarily composed of ice</strong>. The rings of Saturn are made mostly of water ice, with some rocky debris mixed in. The rings are incredibly thin, with a thickness of about 10 meters (30 feet), but they extend outwards from the planet to over 280,000 kilometers (175,000 miles). Saturn's rings are one of the most visually stunning features in our Solar System.

      <strong>Uranus rotates on its side</strong>. Unlike other planets, Uranus has an extreme tilt of about 98 degrees relative to its orbit. This means that Uranus essentially rolls along its orbit rather than spinning like a top. This unusual tilt results in extreme seasonal variations during its 84-year orbit around the Sun.

      <strong>Mars has the tallest volcano in the Solar System</strong>. Olympus Mons is a shield volcano on Mars that stands about 22 kilometers (13.6 miles) high, nearly three times the height of Mount Everest. The volcano's base is about 600 kilometers (373 miles) in diameter, making it one of the most prominent features on the Martian surface.
