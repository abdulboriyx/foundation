      What is Exoplanet?
    </h1>
    <p class="astro-topic-text">
      An exoplanet, or extrasolar planet, is a planet that orbits a star other than the Sun. These planets are located outside our Solar System and revolve around their respective stars, just as Earth orbits the Sun. Exoplanets can vary widely in size, composition, and distance from their host stars, making them a diverse and intriguing field of study in astronomy.

      Why is it essential to learn about Exoplanets
    </h1>
    <p class="astro-topic-text">
      Studying exoplanets is crucial for understanding the potential for life beyond Earth. By exploring the variety of planets that exist in other star systems, scientists can identify those that might have conditions suitable for life. This includes examining their size, composition, and distance from their host stars to determine if they lie within the "habitable zone," where liquid water could exist. Learning about these factors helps us assess the likelihood of finding extraterrestrial life and informs our search for planets that might host life. <br> <br>

      Understanding exoplanets also provides valuable insights into planetary formation and evolution. By comparing exoplanets with those in our own Solar System, researchers can gain a better grasp of how planets form, migrate, and change over time. This knowledge helps refine our models of planetary system development and improves our understanding of the processes that shaped our own Solar System. Moreover, studying a diverse range of planetary systems can reveal the variety of planetary configurations and the factors that influence their evolution. <br> <br>

      Additionally, exoplanet research drives technological innovation and enhances our observational capabilities. The techniques developed to detect and study exoplanets, such as the transit method and radial velocity measurements, have broad applications in other areas of astronomy and space exploration. Advances in telescope technology and data analysis techniques enable us to gather more precise information about distant worlds, pushing the boundaries of what we can observe and learn about the universe. This ongoing progress contributes to the overall advancement of space science and technology.

  <!-- Characteristics of Exoplanets -->
  <div class="astro-topic exoplanets-characteristics">
   <h1 class="astro-header">
      Characteristics of Exoplanets
   </h1>

      <p class="astro-topic-text">
        Exoplanets come in a broad range of sizes, from smaller than Earth to several times larger. They are classified based on their composition, which can be rocky like Earth or gaseous like Jupiter. Some exoplanets are similar to the gas giants in our Solar System, while others are found to be more akin to Neptune or even Earth-sized with rocky surfaces. <br> <br>

        Exoplanets have diverse orbital characteristics. They can orbit their host stars at varying distances, from very close orbits, known as "hot Jupiters," to more distant, Earth-like orbits within the habitable zone where conditions might be suitable for liquid water. Their orbits can be circular or highly elliptical, and they may have different orbital periods ranging from a few days to several years. <br> <br>

        The atmospheres of exoplanets can vary significantly. Some may have thick, dense atmospheres composed of hydrogen and helium, while others might have atmospheres with more complex compositions, including potential signs of water vapor or even exotic gases. Studying these atmospheres helps scientists understand the potential for habitability and the weather patterns on these distant worlds. <br> <br>

        Exoplanets experience a wide range of temperatures depending on their distance from their host star and the starâ€™s characteristics. Planets in the habitable zone of their stars have temperatures that could allow for liquid water, while those closer to their stars might be extremely hot, and those farther out could be icy. The climate of an exoplanet is influenced by its atmosphere, orbital distance, and stellar radiation. <br> <br>

        Identifying exoplanets within the habitable zone of their host stars is a key goal in the search for life. These are regions where conditions might allow for liquid water to exist on the planet's surface. Factors such as the planet's size, atmosphere, and distance from its star contribute to its potential habitability, and scientists use various methods to assess these possibilities.

<h2 class="astro-header">
  Kepler Space Telescope (2009-2018)
</h2>
<p class="astro-topic-text">
  The Kepler Space Telescope, launched by NASA, was a groundbreaking mission dedicated to discovering exoplanets using the transit method. By monitoring the brightness of over 150,000 stars, Kepler identified thousands of exoplanet candidates and confirmed over 2,600 exoplanets. This mission provided a wealth of information on the frequency of Earth-sized planets in the habitable zones of their stars and greatly expanded our knowledge of planetary systems.

  <!-- Facts -->
  <div class="astro-topic exoplanets-facts">
    <h1 class="astro-header">
      Facts about Exoplanets
    </h1>
    <p class="astro-topic-text">
      Some exoplanets experience weather phenomena far beyond what we find on Earth. For instance, exoplanets like HD 189733b exhibit extreme atmospheric conditions, including winds reaching up to 8,700 kilometers per hour (5,400 miles per hour) and temperatures hot enough to vaporize metal. These extreme conditions are influenced by the planet's proximity to its star and its atmospheric composition. <br> <br>

      Not all exoplanets are bound to stars. Some exoplanets, known as rogue or interstellar planets, drift through space without orbiting any star. These planets may have been ejected from their original star systems due to gravitational interactions. Rogue planets can provide insights into the processes that occur during planetary formation and migration. <br> <br>

      The majority of exoplanets discovered so far are gas giants or "mini-Neptunes," which are smaller than Neptune but larger than Earth. These types of exoplanets often have thick atmospheres and may not have solid surfaces, making them very different from Earth-like planets. This highlights the diversity of planetary systems and the variety of planetary environments.<br> <br>

      Just as Saturn has its iconic rings, some exoplanets may also have ring systems. Observations of some exoplanets have suggested the presence of rings, although direct imaging is challenging. The discovery of exoplanetary rings would provide new insights into planetary formation and the dynamics of ring systems. <br> <br>

      In some star systems, exoplanets orbit more than one star. These so-called circumbinary planets orbit two stars, much like Tatooine in Star Wars. The dynamics of such planetary systems are complex and can lead to unique environmental conditions. Studying these systems helps scientists understand how planets can form and survive in such environments.
