      The solar system is a gravitationally bound system comprising the Sun and all the celestial objects that orbit around it. These objects include eight planets and their moons, dwarf planets, asteroids, comets, and meteoroids. The solar system is located in the Milky Way galaxy and formed approximately 4.6 billion years ago from the gravitational collapse of a giant molecular cloud. <br> <br> <br>

      The solar system consists of the Sun at its center, around which eight major planets orbit: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Each of these planets has its own set of moons, with notable examples being Earth's Moon and Jupiter's Ganymede. In addition to the planets, there are smaller celestial bodies known as dwarf planets, including Pluto, Ceres, Haumea, Makemake, and Eris. The solar system also contains asteroids, primarily located in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, as well as comets, which are icy bodies that develop tails when they approach the Sun. Meteoroids, which are small rock or metal fragments, also drift through space within the solar system. Beyond Neptune lies the Kuiper Belt, a region filled with icy bodies and dwarf planets, and even further out is the Oort Cloud, a distant, spherical shell of icy objects that is believed to be the source of long-period comets.

  History and Formation of Solar System
</h1>

<p class="astro-topic-text">
  The Solar System is a vast and intricate system that includes the Sun, planets, moons, asteroids, comets, and other celestial bodies. Understanding its history and formation helps us grasp how these components came together to form the dynamic system we observe today. <br> <br>

 <b>Formation of Solar System</b> - Around 4.6 billion years ago, the Solar System began forming from a giant cloud of gas and dust in space, known as a <b>solar nebula</b>. This cloud, which was mostly hydrogen and helium with some heavier elements, started to collapse under its own gravity. As it collapsed, the cloud spun faster and flattened into a rotating disk. The center of this disk became increasingly hot and dense, eventually forming the <b>Sun</b>. <br> <br>

 In the outer regions of the disk, where temperatures were cooler, small particles of ice and dust began to stick together, forming larger clumps. These clumps collided and merged to form <b>planetesimals</b>, which are building blocks of planets. Over time, these planetesimals continued to collide and merge, forming <b>protoplanets</b>. The largest of these protoplanets became the <b>planets</b> we know today. <br> <br>

 <b>Development of Planets and Other Bodies </b> - As the planets formed, they began to clear their orbits of smaller debris. The inner part of the Solar System, where it was too hot for ices to remain solid, became populated with rocky planets like <b>Mercury</b>, <b>Venus</b>, <b>Earth</b>, and <b>Mars</b>. Further out, where it was cooler, gas giants like <b>Jupiter</b> and <b>Saturn</b> formed, along with icy bodies that became the <b>Uranus</b> and <b>Neptune</b>.
</p> <br>

<p class="astro-topic-text">
 <b>Early Solar System</b> - The early Solar System was a chaotic place with frequent collisions among protoplanets and other debris. These collisions played a significant role in shaping the current arrangement of planets and other bodies. For example, the Moon is thought to have formed from a collision between Earth and a Mars-sized body called Theia.
</p> <br>

<p class="astro-topic-text">
 <b>Current Understanding</b> - Over billions of years, the Solar System has settled into its current structure. The Sun remains the central hub, with planets orbiting it in relatively stable paths. Asteroids and comets continue to travel through their respective regions, providing scientists with clues about the early Solar System.

<div class="astro-topic sun-topic">
  <h1 class="astro-header">
    The Sun
  </h1>

  <p class="astro-topic-text">
    The Sun is the central and most significant component of our Solar System, playing a crucial role in sustaining life on Earth. It is a massive, glowing sphere of hot plasma, primarily composed of hydrogen and helium. The Sun's immense gravitational pull keeps the planets, including Earth, in orbit around it, and its energy is vital for our climate and weather. <br> <br>

    With a diameter of about 864,000 miles (1.39 million kilometers), the Sun is roughly 109 times larger than Earth and contains more than 99% of the total mass of the Solar System. It generates energy through nuclear fusion in its core, where hydrogen atoms combine to form helium, releasing vast amounts of energy in the process. This energy travels through space as sunlight, providing the heat and light necessary for life on Earth. <br> <br>

    The Sun's surface, known as the photosphere, is relatively cooler compared to its core, with temperatures around 5,500 degrees Celsius (9,932 degrees Fahrenheit). Above the photosphere lies the Sun's outer atmosphere, called the corona, which is much hotter, reaching temperatures of up to 1 million degrees Celsius (1.8 million degrees Fahrenheit). This high temperature in the corona creates solar wind, a stream of charged particles that influence space weather and can cause phenomena such as the Northern and Southern Lights (auroras) on Earth. <br> <br>

    The Sun follows an 11-year cycle of solar activity, marked by changes in the number of sunspots, solar flares, and coronal mass ejections. These solar activities can affect satellite communications, power grids, and even climate patterns on Earth. Understanding the Sun's behavior and its influence on the Solar System is essential for both scientific research and practical applications.

<!-- Planets -->
<div class="astro-topic planets-topic">
  <h1 class="astro-header">
    Planets
  </h1>

  <p class="astro-topic-text">
    The Solar System consists of eight main planets which are categorized into two groups: inner planets and outer planets. These classifications are based on their positions relative to the Sun and their physical characteristics. <br> <br>

    The inner planets, also known as terrestrial planets, are the four planets closest to the Sun: Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. These planets are located within the asteroid belt and are primarily composed of rock and metal. They are smaller and more dense compared to the outer planets, with solid surfaces featuring mountains, craters, and volcanoes. The atmospheres of the inner planets vary, with Mercury having almost no atmosphere, Mars and Earth having thin atmospheres, and Venus possessing a thick, toxic atmosphere. <br> <br>

    The outer planets, consisting of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, are located beyond the asteroid belt. Known as gas giants (Jupiter and Saturn) and ice giants (Uranus and Neptune), these planets are primarily made up of hydrogen, helium, and other gases, with Uranus and Neptune containing more ice. They are much larger and less dense than the inner planets, and lack solid surfaces, instead having thick layers of gas with potential solid cores deep within. Their atmospheres are thick, with significant cloud cover and strong winds, contributing to their distinct characteristics.

<!-- Dwarf Planets -->
<div class="astro-topic dwarf-planets-topic">
  <h1 class="astro-header">
    Dwarf Planets
  </h1>

  <p class="astro-topic-text">
    Dwarf planets are celestial objects that orbit the Sun and share some similarities with planets but do not meet all the criteria necessary for full planetary classification. Unlike the eight major planets in our Solar System, dwarf planets are smaller and have not cleared their orbits of other debris.<br> <br>

    <b>Pluto</b> - Once classified as the ninth planet, Pluto is now considered a dwarf planet. It orbits the Sun in the Kuiper Belt, a region of icy bodies beyond Neptune. Pluto has a highly elliptical orbit and a surface covered in ice and rock. It has five known moons, with Charon being the largest and closest.<br> <br>

    <b>Eris</b> - Located in the scattered disk, Eris is one of the most distant known dwarf planets. It is slightly smaller than Pluto but has more mass. Eris is covered in a thick layer of ice and has a moon named Dysnomia. <br> <br>

    <b>Haumea</b> - This dwarf planet resides in the Kuiper Belt and is known for its elongated shape, likely due to its rapid rotation. Haumea has two known moons, Namaka and Hi'iaka, and a surface covered with water ice and crystalline ice. <br> <br>

    <b>Makemake</b> - Also found in the Kuiper Belt, Makemake is known for its lack of an atmosphere and its reddish surface, likely composed of methane and ethane. It has one known moon, discovered in 2015. <br> <br>

    <b>Ceres</b> - The only dwarf planet located in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, Ceres is the largest object in that region. Ceres has a diverse surface with features such as bright spots caused by salt deposits and a possible subsurface ocean. <br> <br>
  </p>
</div>

<!-- Moons -->
<div class="astro-topic moons-topic">
  <h1 class="astro-header">
    Moons
  </h1>

  <p class="astro-topic-text">
    Moons, or natural satellites, are celestial bodies that orbit planets and dwarf planets in our Solar System. They vary widely in size, composition, and appearance, and play significant roles in the planetary systems they belong to. <br> <br>

    <b>Earth's Moon</b> - The most familiar moon, Earth's Moon, is about 1/4 the size of Earth and orbits our planet at an average distance of approximately 238,855 miles (384,400 kilometers). It influences Earth’s tides through its gravitational pull and has a surface marked by craters, mountains, and dark plains known as maria. The Moon's phases—from new to full—are a result of its changing position relative to the Earth and the Sun.<br> <br>

    <b>Jupiter's Moons</b> - Jupiter has the most numerous and diverse moon system in the Solar System, with over 90 known moons. The four largest, known as the Galilean moons, are Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. These moons were discovered by Galileo Galilei in 1610. Io is the most volcanically active body in the Solar System, Europa is believed to have a subsurface ocean that might harbor life, Ganymede is the largest moon, and Callisto is heavily cratered with a potential subsurface ocean. <br> <br>

    <b>Saturn's Moons</b> - Saturn also boasts a vast array of moons, with over 80 confirmed. Titan, Saturn’s largest moon, is larger than the planet Mercury and has a thick atmosphere and lakes of liquid methane. Another notable moon, Enceladus, has geysers that eject water ice and vapor into space, suggesting an underground ocean that could support microbial life.<br> <br>

    <b>Uranus and Neptune’s Moons</b> - Uranus has 27 known moons, including Titania, Oberon, Miranda, and Ariel, which are composed mostly of ice and rock. Neptune, the outermost of the giant planets, has 14 known moons, with Triton being the largest. Triton is unique because it has a retrograde orbit, suggesting it may have been captured by Neptune’s gravity. <br> <br>

    <b>Othe Notable Moons</b> - Beyond the major planets, dwarf planets also have moons. For example, Pluto’s largest moon, Charon, is so large compared to Pluto that they are sometimes considered a double planet system. Haumea, another dwarf planet, has two known moons, Namaka and Hi'iaka. <br> <br>

<!-- Asteroids & Asteroid Belt -->
<div class="astro-topic asteroid-topic">
  <h1 class="astro-header">
    Asteroids and Asteroid Belt
  </h1>

  <p class="astro-topic-text">
    Asteroids are small, rocky bodies that orbit the Sun, primarily found between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. They are remnants from the early Solar System, leftover from the formation of planets. While they vary widely in size—from a few meters to hundreds of kilometers in diameter—they are generally composed of metal and rock.<br> <br>

    <b>Characteristics of Asteroid</b> - Asteroids come in various shapes and compositions. Some are irregularly shaped due to their small size and lack of sufficient gravity to pull them into a round shape. The surface of asteroids can be smooth, cratered, or covered with boulders and debris. Their compositions range from metallic (iron and nickel) to stony (silicate minerals) to a mix of both.<br> <br>

    <b>Notable Asteroids</b> - Notable asteroids include Ceres, the largest object in the asteroid belt, which is also classified as a dwarf planet. Vesta is another large asteroid, known for its bright surface caused by reflective minerals. Eros is a well-studied asteroid visited by NASA’s Near-Earth Asteroid Rendezvous (NEAR) spacecraft.<br> <br>

    <b>The Asteroid Belt</b> - The asteroid belt is a vast region located between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. It contains millions of asteroids, ranging in size from small rocks to large bodies hundreds of kilometers across. The asteroid belt is believed to be remnants of a failed planet formation. The gravitational influence of Jupiter prevented these bodies from coalescing into a planet.<br> <br>

    <b>Importance of Asteroids</b> - Asteroids are considered time capsules of the early Solar System, preserving clues about its formation and evolution. By studying asteroids, scientists gain insights into the conditions and processes that shaped the early Solar System. Additionally, asteroids are of interest for potential future mining and exploration due to their mineral resources. <br> <br>

    <b>Impact Hazards</b> - Some asteroids cross Earth’s orbit and pose potential impact hazards. Monitoring and tracking near-Earth objects (NEOs) is crucial for planetary defense and understanding the risks associated with asteroid impacts. <br> <br>

</div>


<!-- Comets -->
<div class="astro-topic comets-topic">
  <h1 class="astro-header">
    Comets
  </h1>

  <p class="astro-topic-text">
    Comets are icy bodies that orbit the Sun in highly elliptical paths. They are often described as "dirty snowballs" because they are composed of a mixture of ice, dust, and rocky material. Unlike asteroids, which are primarily made of rock and metal, comets contain a significant amount of volatile compounds that can vaporize when they approach the Sun.<br> <br>

    <b>Structure of comets</b> - A comet typically consists of three main parts: <br>
    <ol class="astro-list">
      <li class="astro-list-list astro-topic-text">
        <b>Nucleus</b> - The solid core of a comet, made up of ice and rock. It can be as small as a few hundred meters or as large as 20 kilometers (12 miles) in diameter.
      </li>

      <li class="astro-list-list astro-topic-text">
        <b>Coma</b> - The glowing, cloud-like envelope of gas and dust that forms around the nucleus when the comet is close to the Sun. The heat from the Sun causes the ices in the nucleus to sublimate, creating the coma.
      </li>

      <li class="astro-list-list astro-topic-text">
        <b>Tail</b> - The tail forms when the solar wind and radiation pressure push the gas and dust away from the comet's nucleus. Comets can have two types of tails: a dust tail, which is curved and follows the comet’s orbit, and an ion tail, which is straight and points directly away from the Sun.
      </li>
    </ol>
    </p> <br>

<p class="astro-topic-text">
    <b>Notable Comets</b> - <b>Halley's Comet</b> is one of the most famous comets, known for its periodic appearance every 76 years. It is visible from Earth approximately once in a human lifetime. <b>Comet Hale-Bopp,</b> which was visible to the naked eye in 1997, is another well-known comet. <b>Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9</b> is notable for its spectacular collision with Jupiter in 1994.<br> <br>

    <b>Scientific Significance</b> - Comets are valuable to scientists because they are considered remnants from the early Solar System, preserving information about its formation and the conditions in the outer reaches of the Solar System. Space missions, such as ESA’s Rosetta mission to Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, have provided detailed insights into the composition and behavior of comets.

<!-- Meteoroids, Meteors and Meteorites -->
<div class="astro-topic meteor-topic">
  <h1 class="astro-header">
    Meteoroids, Meteors and Meteorites
  </h1>

  <p class="astro-topic-text">
    Meteoroids are small rocky or metallic bodies that travel through space. They are smaller than asteroids and range in size from tiny grains of sand to objects several meters across. These space rocks can originate from asteroids, comets, or even the Moon and Mars. When they collide with Earth or another planet, they can cause various phenomena.<br> <br>

    <b>Meteors</b> occur when a meteoroid enters Earth's atmosphere and begins to burn up due to friction with the air. This process produces a bright streak of light across the sky, commonly known as a "shooting star" or "falling star." The intense heat generated by the friction causes the meteoroid to vaporize and create a glowing trail. If the meteoroid is large enough and survives its fiery passage through the atmosphere, it can reach the Earth's surface.<br> <br>

   <b>Meteorites</b> are fragments of meteoroids that successfully land on Earth's surface after surviving their atmospheric entry. They come in various types depending on their composition:

    <ol class="astro-list">
      <li class="astro-list-list astro-topic-text">
        <b>Stony Meteorites</b> - Composed mainly of silicate minerals. These are the most common type and resemble terrestrial rocks.
      </li>

      <li class="astro-list-list astro-topic-text">
        <b>Iron Meteorites</b> -  Composed predominantly of iron and nickel. They often have a metallic appearance and can be dense and heavy.
      </li>

      <li class="astro-list-list astro-topic-text">
        <b>Stony-Iron Meteorites</b> -  A mix of silicate minerals and metallic components. These are less common and can have a striking appearance due to their blend of materials.
      </li>
    </ol>
    </p> <br>

    <p class="astro-topic-text">
    <b>Notable Meteorites</b> - Notable meteorites include the <b>Hoba Meteorite</b>, the largest known meteorite, located in Namibia, and the <b>Allende Meteorite</b>, which fell in Mexico in 1969 and provided valuable information about the early Solar System due to its carbonaceous chondrite composition.<br> <br>

    <b>Scientific Significance</b> - Studying meteoroids, meteors, and meteorites provides insights into the composition and history of the Solar System. These objects are essentially remnants from its formation and can reveal information about the conditions and processes that existed in its early stages. Meteorites, in particular, are valuable for understanding the materials and processes that occurred during planetary formation and evolution.<br> <br>

<!-- Kuiper Belt and Oort Cloud -->
<div class="astro-topic kuiper-topic">
  <h1 class="astro-header">
   Kuiper Belt and Oort Cloud
  </h1>

  <p class="astro-topic-text">
    <b>Kuiper Belt</b> - The Kuiper Belt is a vast, donut-shaped region of the Solar System that extends beyond the orbit of Neptune, roughly between 30 and 50 astronomical units (AU) from the Sun (where 1 AU is the average distance from Earth to the Sun). This area is populated with a diverse array of small icy bodies and dwarf planets, including Pluto, Haumea, and Makemake. The Kuiper Belt is believed to be the source of short-period comets, which have orbits that bring them close to the Sun every few years or decades. The belt is named after the Dutch astronomer Jan Kuiper, who proposed its existence in the 1950s. Objects in this region are composed primarily of ice, along with rock and other materials, and include remnants from the early Solar System. The Kuiper Belt is also home to many small, rocky bodies called Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs), which are of great interest to astronomers for understanding the outer Solar System's formation and evolution.<br> <br>

    <b>Oort Cloud</b> - The Oort Cloud is a hypothetical, spherical shell of icy bodies that is believed to encircle the Solar System at distances far beyond the Kuiper Belt, roughly between 2,000 and 100,000 AU from the Sun. It is named after the Dutch astronomer Jan Oort, who proposed its existence in the 1950s to explain the origin of long-period comets, which have orbits that take them hundreds or even thousands of years to complete. The Oort Cloud is thought to be a reservoir of cometary nuclei, with its objects being remnants from the early Solar System. These objects are primarily composed of ice and dust and are believed to have been scattered outward by gravitational interactions with giant planets. The Oort Cloud is not directly observable with current technology due to its great distance and the small size of its constituent objects, but its existence is inferred from the behavior of long-period comets that appear to originate from this distant region.<br> <br>

   <b>Scientific Importance</b> - Both the Kuiper Belt and the Oort Cloud are critical for understanding the formation and evolution of the Solar System. They serve as reservoirs for comets and other small bodies, providing insights into the conditions and processes that existed in the early Solar System. Observations and studies of objects from these regions can reveal much about the primordial materials that formed the planets and the dynamics of the outer Solar System.

    The Sun's outer atmosphere, known as the corona, is significantly hotter than its surface. While the Sun's surface (or photosphere) has a temperature of about 5,500°C (9,932°F), the corona can reach temperatures between 1 to 3 million°C (1.8 to 5.4 million°F). This counterintuitive phenomenon is still a topic of active research, with scientists studying how solar magnetic activity might contribute to this extreme heating.
  </li>

  <li class="astro-list-list astro-topic-text">
    <b>Olympus Mons</b>, a shield volcano on Mars, is the tallest volcano and mountain in the Solar System. Standing about 22 kilometers (13.6 miles) high, it is nearly three times the height of Mount Everest, the tallest mountain on Earth. Olympus Mons is also remarkably wide, with a diameter of approximately 600 kilometers (373 miles), making it an enormous feature on the Martian surface.

  <li class="astro-list-list astro-topic-text">
    Venus has a very slow rotation on its axis, taking about 243 Earth days to complete one rotation. However, it only takes about 225 Earth days for Venus to orbit the Sun. As a result, a single day on Venus (one full rotation) is longer than a year on Venus (one full orbit around the Sun). Interestingly, Venus rotates in the opposite direction to most other planets, meaning the Sun rises in the west and sets in the east on Venus.

  <li class="astro-list-list astro-topic-text">

    <b>Europa</b>, one of Jupiter's largest moons, is believed to have an ocean beneath its icy crust that may contain more water than all of Earth's oceans combined. This subsurface ocean, which could be in contact with Europa's rocky mantle, makes Europa one of the top candidates in the search for extraterrestrial life.

    Saturn's iconic rings are not a single solid structure but rather a collection of countless small particles ranging in size from micrometers to meters. These particles are composed mostly of water ice with some rocky material. The rings are dynamically complex, with gaps and divisions caused by gravitational interactions with Saturn's moons and other processes. The largest gap, known as the <b>Cassini Division</b>, separates Saturn’s A and B rings and is named after the astronomer Giovanni Domenico Cassini who discovered it.
