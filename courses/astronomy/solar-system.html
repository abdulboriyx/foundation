    <p class="astro-text">
      The solar system is a gravitationally bound system comprising the Sun and all the celestial objects that orbit around it. These objects include eight planets and their moons, dwarf planets, asteroids, comets, and meteoroids. The solar system is located in the Milky Way galaxy and formed approximately 4.6 billion years ago from the gravitational collapse of a giant molecular cloud. <br> <br> <br>

      The solar system consists of the Sun at its center, around which eight major planets orbit: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Each of these planets has its own set of moons, with notable examples being Earth's Moon and Jupiter's Ganymede. In addition to the planets, there are smaller celestial bodies known as dwarf planets, including Pluto, Ceres, Haumea, Makemake, and Eris. The solar system also contains asteroids, primarily located in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, as well as comets, which are icy bodies that develop tails when they approach the Sun. Meteoroids, which are small rock or metal fragments, also drift through space within the solar system. Beyond Neptune lies the Kuiper Belt, a region filled with icy bodies and dwarf planets, and even further out is the Oort Cloud, a distant, spherical shell of icy objects that is believed to be the source of long-period comets.

<ol class="astro-list">
  <li class="astro-list-list astro-text">
    The Diamond Planet - 55 Cancri e: <br>
    55 Cancri e is an exoplanet about 40 light-years away in the constellation Cancer. It's often referred to as the "diamond planet" because it's thought to be composed largely of carbon, much of which could be in the form of diamond due to the extreme pressures and temperatures on the planet. This discovery suggests that there are planetary compositions very different from those found in our solar system, offering intriguing possibilities for the diversity of planets in the universe.
  </li>

  <li class="astro-list-list astro-text">
    The Largest Known Structure in the Universe - The Hercules-Corona Borealis Great Wall: <br>
    The Hercules-Corona Borealis Great Wall is a massive galaxy filament and the largest known structure in the universe. It's about 10 billion light-years in length, discovered through the study of gamma-ray bursts. This immense structure challenges our understanding of the universe's large-scale structure and raises questions about how such enormous formations came to be.
  </li>

  <li class="astro-list-list astro-text">
    Rogue Planets: <br>
    Rogue planets are planets that do not orbit any star and instead drift through space. They are thought to be ejected from their original star systems due to gravitational interactions or collisions. Some studies suggest that there could be more rogue planets in our galaxy than stars, potentially offering unique environments vastly different from those of planets within star systems.
  </li>

  <li class="astro-list-list astro-text">
    The Coldest Place in the Universe - The Boomerang Nebula: <br>

    The Boomerang Nebula, located about 5,000 light-years away in the constellation Centaurus, is the coldest known natural place in the universe. With temperatures reaching just 1 degree Kelvin (−272.15 degrees Celsius or −457.87 degrees Fahrenheit), it is even colder than the background temperature of space. The extreme cold is due to the rapid expansion of gas from the dying central star.
  </li>

  <li class="astro-list-list astro-text">
    Cosmic Cannibalism - Galactic Mergers: <br>
    Galactic cannibalism refers to the process by which larger galaxies merge with and consume smaller ones. Our own Milky Way galaxy is on a collision course with the Andromeda galaxy, and in about 4.5 billion years, the two will merge to form a new galaxy, often referred to as Milkomeda or Milkdromeda. Observations of other galaxy mergers help astronomers understand the dynamic and ever-changing nature of galaxies in the universe.
